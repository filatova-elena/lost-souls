narrative: A young man appears before you, his dark eyes bright with excitement. His hands move animatedly as he speaks, his whole form radiating joy and wonder.
content: The Jupiter-Venus conjunction! September 4th, 1925. The alignment was perfect, absolutely perfect! I administered the Elixir of Eternal Love that very morning, just as planned. Cordelia drank it willingly. [You feel hope and romantic idealism—the sense of creating something beautiful.]
