narrative: A vision of a young man materializes, pacing restlessly. His dark eyes are shadowed with worry, his brow creased, one hand running through his hair.
content: Cordelia... something was wrong. She complained of headaches. Nausea. Her hands trembled. I told myself it was just nerves from the engagement, stress from the wedding preparations. But it grew worse. [Confusion and concern begin to creep in, along with a gnawing worry.]
