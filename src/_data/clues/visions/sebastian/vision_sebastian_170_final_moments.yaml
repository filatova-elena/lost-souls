content: The darkness is coming. My heart won't stop racing. I can't catch my breath. I don't know how long I have. And Cordelia... what will happen to Cordelia? Is she suffering too? Will she understand that I never meant to hurt her? [Fading consciousness mixed with worry for the woman you love.]
