narrative: A vision of a young man materializes, his dark eyes wide with dawning realization. His hands tremble as he stares at them, as if they belong to someone else.
content: Cordelia kept getting sicker. Day after day, she grew weaker. I didn't understand. My formula was supposed to strengthen her devotion, not sicken her. What had I done wrong? [Doubt and growing horror begin to grip you.]
