  It's that tea! I KNOW! I KNOW! And they all said I was crazy, but I figured
  it out! The morning ritual, every single day! And all for nothing—I can't even tell
  anyone anymore, no one hears! Are you listening? Please tell me you're LISTENING!
  [Your hands tremble. You feel righteously furious about something you don't understand.]
