narrative: A young woman in a pale dress flickers into view, her blond hair framing a face that belongs in a painting.
content: My brother Thomas... he loved her too, you know. Before all this. Poor Thomas. Lost at sea with so many secrets left behind. [The name Thomas resonates in your chest. Why does it feel familiar? Someone is lost.]
