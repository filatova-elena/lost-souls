narrative: A young woman in a pale dress appears seated, posture rigid, hands clasped tightly in her lap. Her expression shifts between heartbreak and barely contained anger.
content: I tried to tell Thaddeus. He wanted to believe me... I could see it in his eyes. But he just nodded and did nothing. He didn't even try to stop it. He just let it happen. [You feel torn and frustrated, betrayed by someone who should have acted.]
