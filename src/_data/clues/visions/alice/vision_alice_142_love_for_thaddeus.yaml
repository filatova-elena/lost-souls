narrative: A vision of a young woman appears quietly, standing by the window, her hair catching moonlight. Her expression is soft and distant — lost in a memory of someone she loved.
content: Thaddeus, I still love him. How is he? Is he okay? I need to know. [A profound longing reaches out across time. Someone wondering about someone else, hoping they're alright.]
