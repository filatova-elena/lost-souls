narrative: A pale figure shimmers into existence, her delicate features flooding with relief. Tears stream down translucent cheeks as she reaches toward you with trembling hands.
content: Finally. FINALLY someone can hear me! I've been calling out for so long... Cordelia. My dear, sweet friend Cordelia. She was dying and she didn't even know it. [A profound longing and relief wash over you as she speaks.]
