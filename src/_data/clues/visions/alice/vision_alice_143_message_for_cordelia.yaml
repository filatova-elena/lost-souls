narrative: A young woman in a pale dress appears before you, her form bright and urgent, eyes blazing with determination. Her gloved hands grip at the air as though she could shake you into action.
content: I need her to know the truth. Cordelia needs to KNOW! Please tell her! Tell her what he did! [You sense urgency to deliver a message, to absolve someone of guilt they shouldn't carry.]
