narrative: The ghostly figure paces before you, her hair wild, her gloved hands clenching and unclenching. Her bright eyes dart around as if someone might be listening.
content: 'It was him, him all along! But how can I even say such things out loud? I can''t and I won''t! [Frustration and fear surge through you. Someone knows something dangerous but cannot speak it.]'
