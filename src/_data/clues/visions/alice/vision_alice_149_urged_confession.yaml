narrative: A young woman in a pale dress appears before you, standing tall, chin raised, defiant. Her delicate features are set with fierce resolve, her hands balled into fists at her sides.
content: I wouldn't leave. I told him I'd tell EVERYONE. The Montroses. The police. The newspapers! I urged him to confess! All along I thought Sebastian was the monster! [Your heart races. You sense the spirit is distressed and is holding something back.]
