narrative: A vision of a young woman materializes, her hand pressed over her mouth, brown eyes wide with shock and hurt. She looks as though she has just witnessed something she cannot unsee.
content: I saw them together. In the garden at twilight. His hand on her face. Alice! How could he? She is his patient! She is vulnerable! He is taking advantage of her, I just feel it in my bones, I have to do something! [Your heart clenches with betrayal and worry for a friend.]
