narrative: A vision of a young woman materializes, unsteady on her feet. Her wavy hair hangs loose, her skin ashen, one hand pressed to her temple as if fighting a terrible headache.
content: Something was wrong! My head ached. My hands trembled. Food made me sick. I couldn't think clearly. Everyone said it was stress from the wedding preparations, from family pressures. But it grew worse. [Your body echoes her weakness, nausea rising in your throat.]
