narrative: A vision of a young woman appears, her arms wrapped around herself as if cradling an invisible child. Her brown eyes overflow with tears, her lips trembling.
content: I lay in my room growing weaker, and all I could think about was Eleanor. My daughter. The baby I had to give away. Did she know? Would she ever forgive me? [Maternal longing and guilt crash over you like waves.]
