  The doctor came. Dr. Thaddeus came to see me. He looked so concerned, so
  caring. I think he was trying to help! Maybe I was to harsh with him after I found
  them together. I feel the end coming and I feel such a weight on my chest... [You
  feel a terrible, sickening realization creeping in—but not yet complete.]
