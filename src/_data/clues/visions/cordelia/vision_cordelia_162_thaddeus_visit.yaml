narrative: A vision of a young woman appears propped up in bed, her form frail and translucent. She looks up at you with large, trusting brown eyes, her expression confused and vulnerable.
content: The doctor came. Dr. Thaddeus came to see me. He looked so concerned, so caring. I think he was trying to help! Maybe I was to harsh with him after I found them together. I feel the end coming and I feel such a weight on my chest... [You feel a terrible, sickening realization creeping in—but not yet complete.]
