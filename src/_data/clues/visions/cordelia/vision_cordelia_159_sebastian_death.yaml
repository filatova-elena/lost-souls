narrative: A young woman appears, her rose colored dress disheveled, her brown eyes red and swollen. She clutches her arms around herself, rocking slightly.
content: And then Sebastian too. My Sebastian. Poison, I think they said. A mistake. But how? He was so careful with his formulas. So brilliant. He wouldn't make such a mistake. It's so confusing, I can't think straight! [Anguish and confusion battle inside you.]
