narrative: A vision of a young woman in a rose colored dress appears before you, her large brown eyes glistening with tears. Her hands are pressed to her chest as if holding back grief.
content: Alice. Dear, brilliant Alice—my best friend since childhood. She was dead. Fallen down the stairs, they said. But Alice didn't fall. Alice didn't stumble. Something happened to her. [Shock and grief intertwine with something darker—suspicion.]
