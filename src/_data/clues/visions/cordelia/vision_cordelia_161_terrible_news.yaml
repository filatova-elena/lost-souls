narrative: A translucent vision of a young woman appears, seated at the edge of a bed, her shoulders slumped. Her large brown eyes are unfocused, staring at something only she can see.
content: Days blurred together. I remember Sebastian looking worried. I remember wanting to lie down, just wanting to sleep forever. And then... terrible news came. [Confusion and despair flood through you.]
