narrative: A young woman in a rose colored dress appears, barely visible, her form fading in and out. She sways on her feet, one hand braced against the wall, her brown eyes heavy and distant.
content: I'm so tired. So very tired. My heart feels wrong, like it's skipping, like it's breaking inside my chest. And I have so many unanswered questions. So many secrets still buried. [Weakness and mystery intertwine as consciousness begins to fade.]
