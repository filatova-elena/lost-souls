narrative: A young woman in a light blue dress appears by the window, her wavy brown hair catching the light. She stares outward at nothing, her expression hollow with loss.
content: I think about Thomas. My first love. Lost at sea years ago. And now Sebastian... taken too. Why does everyone I love leave me? Why does God keep taking them away? [Desperation and profound sorrow suffuse everything.]
