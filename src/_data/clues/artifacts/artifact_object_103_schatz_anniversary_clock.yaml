  A German Schatz 400-day anniversary clock under a glass dome. These torsion-pendulum clocks were popular wedding and anniversary gifts — wound once a year, they run for 400 days on a single winding. "Made in Germany" stamped on the mechanism. A precision instrument meant to mark the passage of time in a household that clearly valued beautiful mechanical things.
