  A decorative bottle made of venetian glass with gold leaf detailing and an ornate stopper.

  **Authentic Venetian glass** from **early 20th century craftsmanship**.

  This bottle **passed through Harbor Import & Trading Co.** and is documented in historical records. It was imported during **Prohibition (1920-1925)**—check manifests from that period for its exact arrival date.

  During Prohibition, ornate glass bottles like this were perfect for **concealing valuable contraband** while maintaining plausible deniability as decorative pieces. The decorative purpose made it perfect cover for moving contraband.
