  A black and white photograph of a young child playing in a garden, wearing simple white dress with bow.

  **Eleanor as a young child**, years after the infant photograph. The **garden setting matches 1920s Long Beach residential properties**. This is the second photograph in a coordinated sequence—evidence of **deliberate, planned communication** across separated families.

  Someone was documenting Eleanor's development and ensuring Cordelia and Elias knew about it. Find who took these photographs and how they reached Elias Monroe, any letters or correspondence accompanying them, and the **Sullivan family property records**—the garden should help identify the house.
