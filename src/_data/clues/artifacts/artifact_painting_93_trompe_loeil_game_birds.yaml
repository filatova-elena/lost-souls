  A trompe l'oeil ("fool the eye") still life of hanging game birds — a pair of ducks suspended by their feet as if hung from a nail. This genre dates to 17th-century Dutch painting and was a standard dining room subject in wealthy American homes of the late 1800s. The dark background creates the illusion that real birds are hanging on the wall — game you'd serve at the table, displayed above where you'd eat it.
