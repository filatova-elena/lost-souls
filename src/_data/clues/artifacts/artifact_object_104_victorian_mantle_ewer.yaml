content: "A hand-painted opaline glass ewer mounted in an ornate cast brass Rococo\
  \ frame. Pink roses and peonies bloom across the translucent surface. Purely decorative\
  \ — this vessel was never meant to hold liquid. \n\n**YOU OBSERVE**\nThis one seems\
  \ almost too fine for a Long Beach parlor. The brass mount alone suggests European\
  \ craftsmanship. **1920s–1930s** smuggling operations out of the Port of Long Beach\
  \ were known to move more than just liquor. Decorative glass, ceramics, and fine\
  \ art made excellent cover — who questions a crate of Italian glassware?\n"
