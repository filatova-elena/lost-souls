  An exquisite but unfinished wedding dress on a dress form, with intricate beading and lace details.

  **Elias Monroe's work**—every stitch done by hand with meticulous care. This was meant to be **Cordelia's wedding dress for October 1925**. The bodice is complete, perfect in every detail. But the skirt remains partially sewn, pins still marking where final alterations were to be made.

  **Cordelia died before the wedding**. Elias never finished it. This dress is proof of his love for her, and the tragedy of their story. The work pattern shows urgency followed by abrupt cessation. Find Elias Monroe's personal records and correspondence from September-October 1925, his work schedule, and any communications with Cordelia about the dress.
