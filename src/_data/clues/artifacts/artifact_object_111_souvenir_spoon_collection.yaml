  Thirty-four spoons stand in formation on an oak rack—a domestic atlas of a lifetime's travel. The top rows flash with the scarlet **Giglio fleur-de-lis of Florence** , the **Delft blue windmills of Holland** , and the stark **white cross of Switzerland**. Beneath these trophies, a row of figural Apostle spoons stands guard, their handles depicting saints clutching forged emblems of faith such as **St. Peter's key** or **St. John's "cup of sorrow"**. The collection is anchored by the silver-plated profiles of **American Presidents**, their legacies literally etched into the bowls through historical scenes like **Mount Vernon** or the text of the **Gettysburg Address**.

  **YOU OBSERVE**
  Each spoon represents a journey; each journey represents a story, and even in this crowded parlor, not every story is told in full.
