  A black and white photograph showing a group of well-dressed people standing near a waterfront location.

  The warehouse structures in the background match **Harbor Import & Trading Co.** records. **Frankie Romano** stands in the center, in a commanding position. This is actual documentary evidence of the smuggling operation — professional photography like this wasn't common unless it documented something important.

  But who is the man standing slightly back from Frankie's left? The positioning is interesting. He's not family, not clearly Romano. If the other people in this photograph can be identified, it might solve a mystery buried in Long Beach history for decades.
