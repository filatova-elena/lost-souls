  A black and white photograph of an infant in formal white christening gown.

  **Baby Eleanor in formal christening wear**, professionally photographed. This photograph was sent to Elias Monroe and kept hidden among his most precious possessions—proof that he knew about Eleanor's true parentage. **Expensive studio photography** suggests a wealthy family.

  This is the first in a documented sequence tracking Eleanor's childhood. Someone deliberately sent photographs of Cordelia's daughter over the years. Find the **photographer's studio records** (check Long Beach photography studios from 1925), the **Sullivan family records**, and any correspondence between Elias Monroe and the Sullivan family.
