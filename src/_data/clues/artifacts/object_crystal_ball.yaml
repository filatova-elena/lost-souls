  *As you gaze into the crystal sphere, the internal cloud patterns begin to swirl, coalescing into something more than mist. The world around you fades—*

  *"Thaddeus, you must confess. You must go to the authorities—" Her voice steady, but something else there. Hope. "Maybe there is still time—" trails off*

  *The vision blurs. Alice starting towards the stairs. Her face—disappointment and determination. Still hoping—*
