  A faded hand-drawn map on aged paper showing the Montrose Estate grounds with a marked location.

  This is **Frankie Romano's handwriting** — recognizable from shipping documents and business correspondence. The precision of these measurements, the careful notation system — this wasn't a casual drawing. 

  The rose garden location is circled and red x is drawn next to it.
