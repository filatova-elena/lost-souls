  clockmaker: This is a remarkable piece. Gold-plated brass with excellent mechanisms. The interior inscription reads 'September 4, 1925 - 6:14 AM' with astronomical symbols around the numerals—a Jupiter-Venus conjunction. Whoever engraved this understood celestial alignments deeply. This wasn't just an engagement present. It's a record of a specific astronomical moment deemed important enough to carry always. The precision of the time suggests deliberate calculation, not coincidence.
