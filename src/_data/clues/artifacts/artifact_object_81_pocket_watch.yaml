  A gold-plated pocket watch with a glass face and inner inscriptions.

  The interior engraving reads **'September 4, 1925 - 6:14 AM'** with astronomical symbols around the numerals—a **Jupiter-Venus conjunction**. This wasn't just an engagement present. It's a deliberate record of a specific astronomical moment, calculated with precision.

  Something significant happened at this exact moment—a ritual, a beginning, or a crucial event.
