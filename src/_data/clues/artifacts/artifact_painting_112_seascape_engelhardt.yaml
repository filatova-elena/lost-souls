  Oil on canvas, signed and labeled
  Walter Engelhardt (1893–1956)

  A bold seascape of waves crashing against rocks by **Walter Albert Engelhardt**, known for using a bright palette to create bold, decorative scenes of Southern California and its deserts. The early 20th century was a booming period for California landscape paintings. These vibrant, "Free Classic" and Impressionist-influenced works were popular among affluent Southern California families who wanted to showcase the unique beauty of their home state.

  **YOU OBSERVE**

  AS YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THE CANVAS, you notice a piece of paper, weathered and folded, wedged into the frame.

  It reads:

  *Four. **The boats know our secrets**. Where the water runs deep between the islands, where a man can anchor without being seen, where the tide rises and falls by the moon's hand—there we have placed what cannot be traced.*
