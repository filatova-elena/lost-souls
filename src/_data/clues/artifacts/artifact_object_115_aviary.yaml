content: 'The octagonal aviary was built by the mansion''s original owner, a wealthy
  banker who collected exotic birds. It was considered trendy in the early 1900s to
  keep exotic birds, so the original owners built the aviary for their collection.
  It is described as an octagonal tower with a "witch''s cap" roof. It now houses
  several parakeets.


  Among the current residents:


  **Colonel DRAKE** — named for Colonel Charles Drake. The Colonel keeps his watch,
  overseeing the garden with a steady eye.


  **YOU OBSERVE**


  In your head you hear an echo of the words you''ve heard before: "Let my mark be
  your guide and **the Colonel** your trusted ally."
