content: 'A black and white photograph, slightly faded at the edges. A small girl
  in a white dress stands on a flagstone path, one hand reaching toward an overgrown
  bougainvillea that spills over a low stucco wall. Behind her, a citrus tree casts
  long shadows across the garden. A stone birdbath stands half-hidden in the background,
  dark with age.


  On the back is written "Eleanor, 1930".
