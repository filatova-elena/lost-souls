  A machine-woven Jacquard tapestry depicting an 18th-century French Rococo salon scene — courtiers in powdered wigs, a gentleman bowing to a seated lady, elaborate draperies, a birdcage. The walnut frame with its distinctive rounded-corner inset suggests this was originally built into a piece of fine furniture. Tapestry panels like these were produced by French and Belgian mills in Aubusson and Flanders.

  This is a beautiful piece — arguably too beautiful for its current setting. Someone who knew what it was worth placed it here.
