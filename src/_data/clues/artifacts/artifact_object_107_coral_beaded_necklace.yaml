  A multi-strand twisted bead rope in deep coral pink. Genuine Mediterranean coral was among the most prized materials in Victorian and Edwardian jewelry — harvested from the sea, carved and polished into beads, and strung into elaborate necklaces for wealthy women. Coral was also a major trade commodity in Pacific shipping routes. 
  
  **YOU OBSERVE**
  This necklace could have come from a reputable jeweler. Or it could have come from a Romano cargo hold.
