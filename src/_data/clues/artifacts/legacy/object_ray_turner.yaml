  A beautifully produced retrospective documenting paintings from the 1920s-1930s, featuring color photographs and scholarly essays with handwritten annotations in the margins.

  Someone used this book to leave **deliberate clues**. Handwritten annotations appear throughout—repeated references to **vessels and what they might contain**. One annotation reads **'beauty hides secrets'** with an arrow pointing to a particular painting. The recurring theme is concealment: **'What appears empty may hold everything.'**

  **Ray Turner was documenting smuggling operations** through coded annotations. "Vessels," "containment," "beauty hides secrets"—all literal references to how contraband was moved. These annotations are a roadmap of the smuggling operation. Find Ray Turner's personal papers and correspondence, all his annotations in this book, and whether Turner was connected to the Romano family or law enforcement. Pay special attention to paintings that weren't recovered or relocated.
