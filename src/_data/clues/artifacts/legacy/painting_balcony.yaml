  Two panels depicting a woman in elegant dress on a Mediterranean balcony in different moments, meant to hang together.

  An **Italian diptych from the 1870s**—masterwork-level composition and technique. The woman appears in two moments: in the first, serene and contemplative with a wine glass; in the second, she glances back over her shoulder as candlelight catches the glass. The subtle interplay suggests introspection and quiet mystery.

  **The crown jewel of the Romano collection**—and it's still here. The other paintings were donated to the Getty in 1926, but this one was kept. That's significant. The woman's focus on the wine glass across both panels might be literal—there could be something in or behind the glass. Don't overlook the frame; smugglers often hid valuables in ornate frames. Check why this painting wasn't included in the 1926 donation, any correspondence about keeping this specific piece, and whether there are hidden compartments or messages within the frame or painting itself.
