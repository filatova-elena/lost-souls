  A painting depicting bears in a wilderness setting, captured with striking detail and emotion.

  A **Russian masterwork from the 1890s**—the composition shows genuine artistic skill. The sense of power and untamed nature is masterfully rendered. This is **one of three major paintings** from the Romano family collection, valued at thousands in 1925. The brushwork and color palette indicate a trained artist of significant reputation.

  **Russian Peredvizhniki movement work**—imported through Long Beach in the 1920s as European collections were dispersed. One of three coordinated masterworks suggests deliberate assembling of a legacy collection. These paintings are evidence of **significant international smuggling connections** beyond simple bootlegging. Search for Harbor Import & Trading Co. shipping manifests for Russian artwork arrivals, insurance documents or appraisals from 1925-1926, and correspondence between Frankie Romano and European art dealers.
