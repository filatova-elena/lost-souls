content: 'English Staffordshire blue-and-white transferware displayed on the plate
  rail above the wood paneling. The large platter appears to be **Spode''s "Blue Italian"
  pattern** — one of the most iconic designs in English ceramics, in continuous production
  since 1816. The smaller plates show romantic landscape and architectural scenes
  typical of early-to-mid 1800s pottery.


  Likely purchased in Europe during family''s European travel and shipped to Long
  Beach.
