  A time capsule of mid-century American health and hygiene. Dramamine for seasickness on ocean voyages. Entero-Vioform — a traveler's anti-diarrheal for foreign water. Tincture of Merthiolate, a mercury-based antiseptic. Vick's VapoRub. Dorothy Gray face cream "with Hormones." Some bottles still have their original contents. These are the medicines of a family that traveled the world and kept their bathroom stocked.
