content: 'A decorative bottle made of venetian glass with gold leaf detailing and
  an ornate stopper.


  **Authentic Venetian glass** from **early 20th century craftsmanship**.


  This bottle **passed through Harbor Import & Trading Co.** and is documented in
  historical records. It was imported during **Prohibition (1920-1925)**—check manifests
  from that period for its exact arrival date.


  During Prohibition, ornate glass bottles like this were perfect for **concealing
  valuable contraband** while maintaining plausible deniability as decorative pieces.
  The decorative purpose made it perfect cover for moving contraband.
