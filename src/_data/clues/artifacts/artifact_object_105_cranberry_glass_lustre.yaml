  A Victorian cranberry glass candle lustre with hanging crystal prism drops, surrounded by a collection of ruby glass vases, tumblers, and a small pitcher. Cranberry glass gets its deep red color from gold chloride — actual gold dissolved into molten glass. This technique was perfected in Bohemia and at England's Stourbridge glassworks in the mid-1800s. 
  
  **YOU OBSERVE**
  
  The collection displayed here represents considerable value. This might be good evidence the rumors of Romano treasure aren't just rumors after all.
