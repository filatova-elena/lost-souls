  A panoramic photograph of Long Beach's famous Pike amusement zone, circa **1905–1915**. The Bath House, Auditorium, Furlong Pier, Sun Parlor, and Music Shell are all labeled. The Pike opened in 1902 and became the jewel of the Southern California coast — roller coasters, saltwater plunge, dance halls, and a boardwalk that drew thousands. This photograph captures Long Beach in its first golden age, when this mansion was new and this neighborhood was the finest address in the city.
