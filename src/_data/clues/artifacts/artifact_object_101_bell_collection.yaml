  A small collection of bells — brass, cut crystal, and a figural piece with an ornate handle. Bell collecting was a recognized hobby in mid-century America. Like the souvenir spoons elsewhere in the house, each bell likely represents a journey or an occasion. For a musical family, there's something fitting about decorative objects that make sound.
