  A delicate fragment of **ivory silk and Chantilly lace** from a 1920s wedding dress. The fabric is still remarkably preserved despite its age, with intricate hand-sewn details visible along the edges.

  This fragment belonged to **Cordelia Montrose**, the **Heartbroken Ghost**. The workmanship matches **Elias Monroe's** meticulous handiwork—the same dressmaker who created her wedding dress in 1925.

  The fragment shows signs of careful preservation.
