  A decorative vase made of purple clay with gold accents, standing on an ornate wooden stand.

  **South American origin**, possibly Peruvian or Colombian work from the early 20th century. The hand-thrown purple clay and deliberate gold detailing indicate a skilled artisan. The **base is unusually weighted**—suggesting a hidden compartment. This vase contained the rose garden map, but it once held more.

  **Referenced repeatedly in the Ray Turner book annotations**—his annotations about "vessels" and "containment" are literal. This vase was a **smuggling artifact**. Check the Ray Turner book for coded information about its contents, correspondence about commissioning South American pottery, and records of vase repairs or restoration—that's when compartments are accessed.
