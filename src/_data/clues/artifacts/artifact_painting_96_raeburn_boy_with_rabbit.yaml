  Chromolithographic print after Sir Henry Raeburn (1756–1823), the celebrated Scottish portrait painter. One of the most widely reproduced images in the history of decorative art — this gentle scene of a boy and his pet rabbit hung in millions of parlors on both sides of the Atlantic. A sentimental favorite.
