  dressmaker: This photograph was sent to Elias, my ancestor. It shows a baby Eleanor in formal christening wear, professionally photographed. The fact that Elias kept this hidden among his most precious possessions suggests he knew about Eleanor''s true parentage. Someone deliberately sent him photographs of Cordelia''s daughter over the years.

    Expensive studio photography of an infant suggests wealthy family. This photo was hidden carefully—someone risked keeping it. Find: 1) The photographer''s studio records (check Long Beach photography studios from 1925), 2) The Sullivan family records (they appear to have sent these photos), 3) Any correspondence between Elias Monroe and the Sullivan family. This is the first in a documented sequence tracking Eleanor''s childhood. The photographer might have records of who commissioned these portraits.
