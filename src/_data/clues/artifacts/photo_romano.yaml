  A black and white photograph showing a group of well-dressed people standing near a waterfront location.

  **Long Beach's working waterfront**—the warehouse structures match **Harbor Import & Trading Co. records**. **Frankie Romano** stands in the center, commanding position. Professional photography like this wasn't common unless it documented something important. **Early 1930s**—this matches the timeline of the smuggling operation.

  There's a man standing slightly back from Frankie's left—the positioning is interesting. He's not family, not clearly Romano. This is documentary evidence of the operation. Identifying the other people in this photograph could solve mysteries buried in Long Beach history for decades.
