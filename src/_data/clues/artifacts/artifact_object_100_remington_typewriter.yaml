content: 'A Remington Standard No. 10, introduced in **1908** and produced through
  the 1930s. The workhorse of American business. Mr. Montrose ran his affairs from
  this desk — correspondence, contracts, accounts. The machine still has a ribbon
  in place, as if someone might sit down tomorrow and resume typing where they left
  off decades ago.
