  An oak-cased magneto wall telephone, circa **1900–1920**. You'd turn the crank to signal the operator, then speak into the mouthpiece while pressing the receiver to your ear. Three generations of telephone technology exist in this house — this crank model, a candlestick phone from the 1920s, and a rotary dial from the 1940s.
