  A black and white photograph of a young girl standing in front of a house, with a more mature expression.

  **Eleanor at age 10**, the final photograph in the sequence. She's old enough now that **her mother's features are becoming visible** in her face. Compare her facial features to known photographs of Cordelia Montrose—the resemblance should be obvious.

  Elias kept all three photographs hidden together—documentation of Eleanor's childhood that Cordelia could never experience directly. The sequence suggests either a **planned endpoint or a sudden interruption**. This photograph might be the last contact between the families. Find what happened after this final photograph (1935), whether there are later photographs or why they stopped, and whether Eleanor was ever told about Cordelia.
