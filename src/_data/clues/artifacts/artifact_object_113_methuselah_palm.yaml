  Washingtonia robusta — Mexican Fan Palm


  In the early 1900s, wealthy Southern California homeowners prized these palms as
  symbols of tropical elegance and permanence. This species is native to the desert
  canyons of Baja California and Sonora, where specimens have been documented exceeding
  500 years of age.


  It is nicknamed "Methuselah" after the Biblical patriarch said to have lived 969
  years.

  **YOU OBSERVE**


  AS YOU EXAMINE THE BASE OF THE TREE, you notice a piece of paper, weathered and
  folded, wedged into the bark as if someone placed it here deliberately — and long
  ago.


  It reads:


  *Two. **The paintings we love**—those beautiful works that caught our eye in dark
  rooms and summer galleries. They are safe in places of honor, in the care of those
  who appreciate beauty and ask no questions.*'
