  A circular oil painting — a tondo — of a colorful bouquet in a purple vase, with a pink draped cloth. Signed "H. de..." Delphiniums, snapdragons, hydrangeas, roses, zinnias — a riot of garden flowers bursting from that distinctive purple vessel.

  **YOU OBSERVE**

  As you look closely at the painting, you see a note, hidden gently between the frame and the canvas.

  It reads:

  Three. **Purple is the color of royalty. Gold is the color of wealth.** If only one could find such a vessel, in his hand, he would hold the power of the Romanos.
