  Started the operation down at the harbor tonight. We're calling it the Garden - where you plant the right seed, things grow real nice. The boats come in after dark. Medicine, they tell the cops. Everybody laughs. Already got connections with the Montrose family and their crowd. They're thirsty and we got the juice. That's how it works.
