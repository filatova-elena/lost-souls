  Got introduced to a young pharmacist today - Sebastian Crane. Kid's a dreamer, talks about love potions and alchemy like he's some kinda poet. But he's smart. Real smart with his bottles and formulas. No one looks twice at a pharmacist. I'm thinking partnership. His stuff could move real smooth through legitimate channels. Already talked about moving some of our assets into his care. Hidden right out in the open where nobody's gonna look.
