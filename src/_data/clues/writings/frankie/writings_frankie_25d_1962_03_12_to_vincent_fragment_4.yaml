  Five. **Let my mark be your guide** and **the Colonel** your trusted ally.

  You must be patient. You must be careful. You must be worthy.

  When you understand these words, you will know what to do. You are my blood, Vincent. You are my legacy. You are the only one I would entrust with paradise.

  Remember where the sun sets, Vincent. Remember this always.

  Your uncle who loves you,
  Frankie
