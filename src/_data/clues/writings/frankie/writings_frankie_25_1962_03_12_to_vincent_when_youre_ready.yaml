  My dear Vincent,

  If you are reading this, it means the time has come when you must be ready. The hand of the law is heavy, and I have made my choices with clear eyes.

  I leave you not with tears, but with knowledge. What I have built, what I have protected, now passes to you. You are the only one I trust with this burden.

  Remember these words, for they hold everything:

  Where the sun sets in the west, our fortune waits. Not in banks where the clerks keep their tallies, but in places where only those who truly know can look.

  First, the garden where we watched the sunset go down. The white roses remember what the earth keeps. Beneath them, sealed in copper, rests what gold can purchase. Forty-four years of spring, buried where mourning flowers bloom.

  Second, the paintings we love—those beautiful works that caught our eye in dark rooms and summer galleries. They are safe in places of honor, in the care of those who appreciate beauty and ask no questions. They are donations from respectable families. Look in the records under names you know, and you will find them. Three names, three museums, three pieces of our heart that the world has come to treasure.

  Third, the boats know our secrets. Where the water runs deep between the islands, where a man can anchor without being seen, where the tide rises and falls by the moon's hand—there we have placed what cannot be traced. Remember: spring tide, summer solstice, the nights when the moon is full. The boats know the rhythm. So must you.

  Fourth, the walls themselves hold what we have hidden. Beneath where the wine is kept, where no blueprint shows, where the architect knew to ask nothing—there the foundation of our empire remains sealed. It is the greatest treasure of all, Vincent. It is the fortress.

  You must be patient. You must be careful. You must be worthy.

  Do not speak of this. Do not write of this. Carry it in your heart until you are certain it is time. The authorities will watch you. They will listen. But they cannot hear what you do not say.

  When you understand these words, you will know what to do. You are my blood, Vincent. You are my legacy. You are the only one I would entrust with paradise.

  I go now to pay for my choices. But my fortune—our fortune—it will wait for you. In the garden. In the paintings. In the deep water. In the walls.

  Where the sun sets in the west, Vincent. Remember this always.

  Your uncle who loves you,
  Frankie

  ## Decoded Locations

  Frankie's letter contains **four specific treasure locations**, all west-facing from the harbor:

  **1. The Rose Garden** — "The white roses remember what the earth keeps." Gold and bonds buried beneath the rose garden at the Montrose mansion, sealed in copper. Forty-four years of accumulated wealth.

  **2. Three Paintings in Museums** — "Donations from respectable families." Three major artworks donated to California museums between 1925–1928 under the name "Montrose family donations": a **Caravaggio at the Legion of Honor**, a **Vermeer at the Getty**, and a **second Caravaggio at the Huntington**.

  **3. The Island Caches** — "Where the water runs deep between the islands." Accessible at **spring tide during full moons**, especially near the **summer solstice**. The boats returned on the same astronomical dates each year to maintain or check the caches. The timing is literally written in the sky.

  **4. The Hidden Basement** — "Beneath where the wine is kept." A concealed room beneath the wine cellar at the mansion, where no blueprint shows. The architect knew to ask nothing. This is "the fortress" — the greatest treasure of all.

  *"Where the sun sets in the west"* — all four locations follow a westward pattern from the port.
