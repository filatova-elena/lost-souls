  My dear Vincent,

  If you are reading this, it means the time has come when you must be ready. The hand of the law is heavy, and I have made my choices with clear eyes.

  I leave you not with tears, but with knowledge. What I have built, what I have protected, now passes to you. *It is the fortress, Vincent. It is the greatest treasure of all.*

  Remember these words, for they hold everything:

  One. Where the sun sets behind **old Methuselah**, the wind heavy with salt air will whisper secrets long forgotten.

  ---
  **YOU OBSERVE**

  The sun, the wind... Old Methuselah... What could it be? A statue? A fountain maybe? Must be something large and old.
