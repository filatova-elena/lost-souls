character_interpretations:
  dressmaker: Looking at these measurements, I notice what Elias noticed—Cordelia is getting thinner. Her frame is becoming more delicate, her waist narrower than it should be. I remember seeing his notes about the adjustments needed, the way he documented the changes with such care. These measurements aren't just numbers. Cordelia was getting sicker. Every fitting required new adjustments.
