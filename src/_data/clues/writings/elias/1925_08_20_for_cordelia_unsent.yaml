  She turns to roses in the garden light,
  Not knowing I have fallen into night.
  Each word she speaks, I cannot say my own—
  So beautiful, and yet forever alone.

  I tell her of the flowers, nothing more.
  My heart lies shattered on her garden floor.
character_interpretations:
  dressmaker: Reading Elias's words, I understand what he never said aloud. 'My heart lies shattered on her garden floor.' He loved her so completely, so hopelessly. Yet Cordelia chose someone else. She chose a man who was poisoning her, so unfair. And Elias—my ancestor—had to watch. Had to see her fade while he remained silent, unable to speak his love. He chose to be the faithful witness instead.
