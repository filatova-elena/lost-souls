  I finished the wedding dress today.

  Every stitch is a prayer.
  Every seam is a memory.
  Every button is something I will never be able to give her.

  I pressed it carefully. Wrapped it in tissue. Stored it in the back room where no one goes.

  She will never wear it now.

  Something is wrong. I can see it in the way she moves, the way she breathes. The dress hangs unworn in the darkness, like a ghost of the future that will never arrive.

  I will keep it. I will preserve it.

  Maybe someday someone will understand what this dress means. What it meant to make it. What it means to love someone you can never have.

  Maybe keeping it will be enough.
