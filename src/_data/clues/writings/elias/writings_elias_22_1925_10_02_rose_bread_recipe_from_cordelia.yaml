  She brought me this today. Said it was her grandmother's recipe, something her family has made for generations.

  Ingredients:
  - Bread flour: 500g
  - Warm water: 350ml
  - Instant yeast: 7g
  - Sea salt: 10g
  - Honey: 15g
  - Olive oil: 30ml
  - Rose water: 1/4 teaspoon (USE SPARINGLY—this is precious)
  - Dried rose petals: 2 tablespoons, finely ground

  Method:
  Mix flour, water, yeast, salt, honey, and oil.
  Knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth.
  After dough rises slightly (1-2 hours), fold in rose water and ground rose petals carefully.
  Let rise for 4-6 hours (or overnight in refrigerator).
  Shape into a round loaf.
  Final rise 2-3 hours.
  Bake at 450°F for 35-40 minutes.
  Brush with honey glaze before final bake.

  Note from Cordelia: 'This bread carries memory. Every person who eats it becomes part of our family's story. I want Eleanor to have this—to know she is connected to something beautiful, even if she doesn't know all the reasons why.'

  I copied this carefully. I will make sure Eleanor receives it.
