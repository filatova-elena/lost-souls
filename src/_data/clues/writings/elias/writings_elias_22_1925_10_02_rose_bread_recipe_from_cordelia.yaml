  She brought me this today. Said it was her grandmother's recipe, something her family has made for generations.

  **Rose Bread**  

  500g flour (bread flour, the strong kind)
  350ml water, warm
  packet of yeast
  salt — abt 2 tsp?
  spoonful of honey
  good olive oil, maybe 2 tbsp
  rose water — just a few drops, she was very clear about this dried rose petals, crushed up fine — a small handful

  Mix it all together except the rose water and petals.
  Knead a long time, until it feels right.
  Let it rise.
  Then fold in the rose water and petals, carefully.
  Let it rise again, longer this time — she said overnight is best.
  Shape it into a round loaf.
  One more rise.
  Hot oven, 450°. About 35-40 minutes.
  Brush honey on near the end.

  She said the petals lose their color in the oven and not to worry about it.

  She said her grandmother used to say the bread remembers the roses even after the color is gone.

  I will make sure Eleanor receives it.
