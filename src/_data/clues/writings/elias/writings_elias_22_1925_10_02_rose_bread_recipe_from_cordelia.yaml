  \ her family has made for generations.\n\n**Rose Bread**  \n\n500g flour (bread\
  \ flour, the strong kind)\n350ml water, warm\npacket of yeast\nsalt — abt 2 tsp?\n\
  spoonful of honey\ngood olive oil, maybe 2 tbsp\nrose water — just a few drops,\
  \ she was very clear about this dried rose petals, crushed up fine — a small handful\n\
  \nMix it all together except the rose water and petals.\nKnead a long time, until\
  \ it feels right.\nLet it rise.\nThen fold in the rose water and petals, carefully.\n\
  Let it rise again, longer this time — she said overnight is best.\nShape it into\
  \ a round loaf.\nOne more rise.\nHot oven, 450°. About 35-40 minutes.\nBrush honey\
  \ on near the end.\n\nShe said the petals lose their color in the oven and not to\
  \ worry about it.\n\nShe said her grandmother used to say the bread remembers the\
  \ roses even after the color is gone.\n\nI will make sure Eleanor receives it."
