  Cordelia came for her final dress fitting. She looked pale. Thinner than before. Her hands trembled as I adjusted the bodice.

  'I've been feeling unwell,' she said. 'Sebastian has been giving me something. A tonic. He says it's for our love, for our future together.'

  A tonic? What kind of tonic makes someone this ill? Her color is wrong. There's a tremor in her voice.

  I wanted to say something. I wanted to tell her to stop drinking whatever he's given her. But what right do I have? She belongs to him. She trusts him completely.

  Still, I cannot shake the feeling that something is terribly wrong with Sebastian Crane. And my beautiful Cordelia is drinking whatever poison he calls love.
character_interpretations:
  dressmaker: This is the note my ancestor wrote, the moment he realized. He saw what no one else could see—not yet, anyway. He watched her deteriorate and he knew. He couldn't prove it. Couldn't stop it. But he knew. And he blamed Sebastian. My ancestor was right to be worried. He was right to be suspicious. But he was powerless to save her.
