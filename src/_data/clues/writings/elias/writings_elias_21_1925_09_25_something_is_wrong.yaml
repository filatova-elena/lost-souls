content: 'Cordelia came for her final dress fitting. She looked pale. Thinner than
  before. Her hands trembled as I adjusted the bodice.


  ''I''ve been feeling unwell,'' she said. ''Sebastian has been giving me something.
  A tonic. He says it''s for our love, for our future together.''


  A tonic? What kind of tonic makes someone this ill? Her color is wrong. There''s
  a tremor in her voice.


  I wanted to say something. I wanted to tell her to stop drinking whatever he''s
  given her. But what right do I have? She trusts him completely.


  Still, I cannot shake the feeling that something is terribly wrong with Sebastian
  Crane. And my beautiful Cordelia is drinking whatever poison he calls love.'
