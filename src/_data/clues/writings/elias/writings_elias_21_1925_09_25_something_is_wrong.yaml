  Cordelia came for her final dress fitting. She looked pale. Thinner than before. Her hands trembled as I adjusted the bodice.

  'I've been feeling unwell,' she said. 'Sebastian has been giving me something. A tonic. He says it's for our love, for our future together.'

  A tonic? What kind of tonic makes someone this ill? Her color is wrong. There's a tremor in her voice.

  I wanted to say something. I wanted to tell her to stop drinking whatever he's given her. But what right do I have? She trusts him completely.

  Still, I cannot shake the feeling that something is terribly wrong with Sebastian Crane. And my beautiful Cordelia is drinking whatever poison he calls love.
