  [Written in shaky hand]

  I am dying. And I deserve to be.

  I spent years working on a formula I knew nothing about. Thought I could capture LOVE in liquid form. I, a man who once mixed the wrong ratio of potassium bromide and nearly went blind, could be trusted with Cordelia's wellbeing.

  I did not verify storage conditions. Did not account for temperature fluctuations. I considered this only AFTER my fiancée began showing symptoms.

  I tested on myself—me, the least qualified person to test anything. Should have consulted more with Hartley. Should have been more careful.

  And now Cordelia is dying because I was careless. Because I was arrogant.

  I gave her poison thinking it was poetry.
