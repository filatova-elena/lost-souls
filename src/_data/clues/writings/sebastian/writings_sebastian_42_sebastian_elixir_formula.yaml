  \ sweetener, preservation\n    Preparation: Premium quality honey\n    Quantity:\
  \ 5 lbs total\n\n---\n\n## You observe:\n\nThe proportions show **mathematical thinking**,\
  \ not folk remedy guessing. Three parts damiana and two parts valerian create a\
  \ base — but damiana excites and awakens, while valerian calms and grounds.\n\n\
  Ginseng as a \"binding agent for eternal love\" is not traditional botanical use\
  \ — it suggests **mystical thinking** rather than botanical science. \n\n**Rose\
  \ otto's** effects are primarily aromatic and psychological.\n\nThe formula as a\
  \ whole would create a liquid that tastes pleasant, induces mild relaxation through\
  \ the bromide and valerian, and leaves the drinker susceptible to suggestion through\
  \ the powerfully aromatic rose otto. **The effect would be primarily psychological.**\n\
  \n## Pharmaceutical Concerns\n\nPotassium bromide at 10 grains is a standard sedative\
  \ dosage. Calcium lactate and iron citrate are fortifying agents, nothing dangerous\
  \ individually. But potassium bromide **interacts with certain plant alkaloids**.\
  \ If storage failed and concentrations changed, or if someone miscalculated interactions,\
  \ the 8 ounces of grain alcohol at 95% proof would accelerate degradation of certain\
  \ compounds."
