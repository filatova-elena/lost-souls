  ## You observe:

  The proportions show **mathematical thinking**, not folk remedy guessing. Three parts damiana and two parts valerian create a base — but damiana excites and awakens, while valerian calms and grounds.

  Ginseng as a "binding agent for eternal love" is not traditional botanical use — it suggests **mystical thinking** rather than botanical science. 
  
  **Rose otto's** effects are primarily aromatic and psychological.

  The formula as a whole would create a liquid that tastes pleasant, induces mild relaxation through the bromide and valerian, and leaves the drinker susceptible to suggestion through the powerfully aromatic rose otto. **The effect would be primarily psychological.**

  ## Pharmaceutical Concerns

  Potassium bromide at 10 grains is a standard sedative dosage. Calcium lactate and iron citrate are fortifying agents, nothing dangerous individually. But potassium bromide **interacts with certain plant alkaloids**. If storage failed and concentrations changed, or if someone miscalculated interactions, the 8 ounces of grain alcohol at 95% proof would accelerate degradation of certain compounds.
