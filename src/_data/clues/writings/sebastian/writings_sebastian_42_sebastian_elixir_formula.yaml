  ## You observe:

   Three parts damiana and two parts valerian create a base — damiana excites and awakens, valerian calms and grounds. The use of Ginseng suggests **mystical thinking** rather than botanical science. **Rose otto's** effects are primarily aromatic and psychological.

  The formula as a whole would taste pleasant and induce a mild relaxation through the bromide and valerian. **The effect would be primarily psychological.**

  ## Pharmaceutical Concerns

  Potassium bromide at 10 grains is a standard sedative dosage. Calcium lactate and iron citrate are fortifying agents, nothing dangerous individually. But potassium bromide **interacts with certain plant alkaloids**. If storage failed and concentrations changed, or if someone miscalculated interactions, the 8 ounces of grain alcohol at 95% proof would accelerate degradation of certain compounds.
