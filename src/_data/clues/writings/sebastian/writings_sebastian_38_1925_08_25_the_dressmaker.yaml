content: "Elias Monroe has been spending considerable time with Cordelia on the dress alterations. Fittings, measurements, consultations—it all seems excessive. I know he is a craftsman, meticulous about his work, but something in his demeanor troubles me.\n\nCordelia insists the dress is not yet perfect, that he is merely being thorough. \n\nAnd yet. But I have faith in my elixir, I feel us becoming more bound. The ritual draws us closer. By the wedding day, she will be mine completely, in ways that no dressmaker's needle can accomplish."
