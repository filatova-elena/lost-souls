  Thaddeus gave me a pocket watch for my engagement. Extraordinary—it's engraved inside with September 4, 1925, 6:14 AM. The conjunction of Jupiter and Venus.

  How does my brother know of my consultations with Hartley? How does he know I chose September 4th for the ritual?

  I took it to a craftsman and had the conjunction symbols engraved around the numerals. Beautiful. I will carry it always.

  Thaddeus's card spoke of timing written in the stars. Perhaps he understands what I'm attempting.
