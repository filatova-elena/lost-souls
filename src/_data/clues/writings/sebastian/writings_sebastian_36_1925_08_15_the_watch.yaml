content: 'Thaddeus gave me a pocket watch for my engagement. Extraordinary—it''s engraved
  inside with September 4, 1925, 6:14 AM. The conjunction of Jupiter and Venus.


  How does my brother know of my consultations with Hartley? How does he know I chose
  September 4th for the ritual?


  I took it to a craftsman and had the conjunction symbols engraved around the numerals.
  Beautiful. I will carry it always.


  Thaddeus''s card spoke of timing written in the stars. Perhaps he understands what
  I''m attempting.'
