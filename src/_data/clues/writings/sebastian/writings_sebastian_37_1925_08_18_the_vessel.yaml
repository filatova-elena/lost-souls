  A potion as delicate as the Elixir of Eternal Love deserves a container worthy of it.

  Found the most beautiful Venetian glass bottle at Harbor Import & Trading Co. Emerald green with gold leaf detailing, crafted with such precision.

  The container reflects the contents. If my elixir is exquisite, it must reside in something equally exquisite. Cordelia will drink from this bottle. The beauty will remind her of our love.
