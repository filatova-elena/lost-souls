  **Episode 3: The Romano Treasure - Mob Money Myth or Real Fortune?**

  Frankie 'the Coast' Romano ran bootlegging operations at the Port of Long Beach during Prohibition. When federal authorities seized his assets in the 1960s, they recovered less than half of what he supposedly accumulated. The legend: Frankie hid millions before the feds arrived.

  We trace the rumors, examine property records, interview family members, and ask the question - is the 'Romano Treasure' a real fortune waiting to be found, or an elaborate family myth?
