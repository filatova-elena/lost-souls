  **Episode 1: The Vanishing Bride - What Really Happened to Cordelia Montrose?**

  In October 1925, three people died mysteriously at the Montrose mansion in Long Beach. The official story: Cordelia Montrose died of a broken heart after her new fiancé Sebastian suddenly passed away. 

  But Cordelia and Sebastians were not the only one who died that October. 

  Alice Whitmore, Cordelia's best friend, was found dead only a few days prior.

  We investigate the theory that something far more sinister was at play. Was it truly grief? Or could there be a darker explanation.
