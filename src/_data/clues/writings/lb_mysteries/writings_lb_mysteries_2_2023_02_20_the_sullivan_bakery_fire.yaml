  **Episode 2: The Sullivan Bakery Fire - Accident or Arson?**

  In 1990, the Sullivan family bakery - a Long Beach institution for generations - burned to the ground under suspicious circumstances. Two people were found dead inside. The official investigation ruled it an accident caused by electrical wiring. But locals whisper about a family connection to the 1925 deaths.

  We examine the fire investigation records, interview fire marshals, and question whether this was truly an accident or if someone wanted that bakey gone.
