content: 'I am so tired. Exhausted in a way that sleep doesn''t fix. Everything feels
  heavy. My limbs ache. There''s a persistent nausea that comes and goes.


  I told myself it was the preparation stress. Planning a wedding while feeling unwell
  is its own special torture.


  But I keep drinking the elixir. Because when I drink it, for just a moment, I feel
  like everything might be all right. Like Sebastian''s devotion might be enough to
  heal whatever is broken in me.


  Mother asked if I was ill. I told her no. I told her I was fine.'
