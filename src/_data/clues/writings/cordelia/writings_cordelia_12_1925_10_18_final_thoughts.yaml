  I am dying. I know this now with absolute certainty.


  My body is failing. My heart is struggling. Each breath feels like a monumental effort. The doctors have stopped pretending they know what is wrong with me.


  I keep thinking about Eleanor. My daughter. Is she alive? Is she well? Does she know I didn't choose to leave her?


  I should have been stronger. I should have fought to keep her.


  Instead, I chose stability. But nothing was ever safe. Thomas left me. My family betrayed me. And I am running out of time.


  If there is any mercy in this world, let Eleanor know that her mother loved her. That I think of her in these final moments. That I would give anything to see her face.
