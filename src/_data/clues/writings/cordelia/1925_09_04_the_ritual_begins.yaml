  This morning, Sebastian gave me the elixir. He called it a sacred ceremony. A gift before our wedding.

  The liquid is pale amber, almost glowing in the light. It tastes sweet—cherry and honey, with something herbal underneath. Something that tastes like promises.

  He drank from the same cup I did. 'We are drinking our future together,' he said.

  I felt something shift inside me. Not magic, not in the way the old stories speak of magic. But something real. A sense of rightness. Of belonging to someone completely, and having them belong to me.

  Every morning now. This will be our ritual.
