  Sebastian is dead.

  They said his heart simply stopped. That his body couldn't sustain the strain.

  I cannot process this. I cannot form words around it. The man who loved me so completely, who created something beautiful for me, is gone. And I am still here. Still sick. Still confused.

  I don't understand what happened. I don't understand any of it.

  All I know is that I am alone again. And something inside me is breaking.
