  I can barely leave my bed now. Every movement exhausts me. My heart races at irregular intervals, then slows to an unsettling crawl. I have difficulty breathing sometimes. The doctors are confused.

  Dr. Thaddeus came to examine me. He was very thorough. Very clinical. He assured me it was likely grief—my body's response to losing Sebastian so suddenly.

  Nothing to be concerned about, he said.

  But I don't think that's what this is.

  I am afraid.
