content: "I am dying. I know this now with absolute certainty.\n\nMy body is failing. My heart is struggling. Each breath feels like a monumental effort. The doctors have stopped pretending they know what is wrong with me.\n\nI keep thinking about Eleanor. My daughter. Is she alive? Is she well? Does she know I didn't choose to leave her?\n\nI should have been stronger. I should have fought to keep her. \n\nInstead, I chose stability. But nothing was ever safe. Thomas left me. My family betrayed me. And I am running out of time.\n\nIf there is any mercy in this world, let Eleanor know that her mother loved her. That I think of her in these final moments. That I would give anything to see her face."
