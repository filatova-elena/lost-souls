  I am so tired. Exhausted in a way that sleep doesn't fix. Everything feels heavy. My limbs ache. There's a persistent nausea that comes and goes.

  I told myself it was the preparation stress. Planning a wedding while feeling unwell is its own special torture.

  But I keep drinking the elixir. Because when I drink it, for just a moment, I feel like everything might be all right. Like Sebastian's devotion might be enough to heal whatever is broken in me.

  Mother asked if I was ill. I told her no. I told her I was fine.
