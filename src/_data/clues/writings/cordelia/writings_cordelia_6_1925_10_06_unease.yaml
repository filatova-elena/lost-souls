  I've been feeling strange the past few days. A heaviness in my chest. My heart feels... fluttering. Irregular. Sometimes it races, sometimes it seems to slow.

  I attributed it to excitement about the wedding. To nerves. But today the feeling persisted even in the evening.

  When I mentioned it to Sebastian, he looked worried. He said the elixir should make me feel strong, not weak. He asked if I wanted to stop drinking it.

  I said no. Of course not. The problem is not the elixir. The problem is the weight of everything else. The weight of my past. The weight of decisions made long ago that I cannot unmake.

  The elixir is the only thing that feels true anymore.
