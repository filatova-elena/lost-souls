content: 'I saw her today. Alice. My dearest friend, or she used to be. We''ve barely
  spoken in months. It''s been easier that way.


  But today she looked so fragile. So lost. And I heard the rumors about Dr. Thaddeus
  and... and her.


  I couldn''t stay silent. Not with Alice at risk. So I went to him. To Thaddeus.
  I told him to end it immediately, or I would expose his affair to the entire medical
  board, to all of Long Beach society. I told him I would destroy his reputation if
  he didn''t leave her alone.


  He just smiled at me. And said: ''How very protective of you, Cordelia. How very
  noble.''


  I''ve never liked him.'
