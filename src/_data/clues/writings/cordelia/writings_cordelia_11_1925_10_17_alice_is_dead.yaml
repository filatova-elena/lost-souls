  I learned today that Alice is dead. They said she fell. An accident.

  Alice. My oldest friend. The one I pushed away because I couldn't bear her presence.

  I should have been there for her. I should have continued to protect her. Instead, I abandoned her when she needed me most.

  And now Thaddeus's affair with her is public knowledge. The scandal is all anyone speaks of.

  I threatened to expose him. But I didn't do it. I was too weak, too ill. And now Alice is dead and I will never get the chance to ask her forgiveness.
