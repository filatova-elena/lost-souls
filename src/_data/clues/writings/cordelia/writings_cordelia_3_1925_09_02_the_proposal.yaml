  He proposed today. On his knee in the same garden where we met weeks ago. The ring is beautiful—not ostentatious, but thoughtful. He said he's been working on something special. An elixir. For us.

  I said yes.

  I told myself it's because he's steady and devoted. Because he won't leave me. Because he looks at me like I'm his entire world, and I am exhausted from being invisible.

  But that's not entirely true. I love him. It's different from Thomas—less wild, more... grounded. Like coming home after a very long journey.
