character_interpretations:
  mortician: Silas's observations show poisoning over time allowing for cumulative organ damage.
  town_doctor: The cardiac damage pattern in Cordelia is consistent with gradual cardiotoxicity. Her kidneys show scarring from prolonged exposure to a toxin. Likely slow poisoning over time.
  botanist: The residue on her lips is from something sweet and herbal consumed regularly. If someone substituted a toxic ingredient into a daily preparation, small doses would accumulate over time. This kind of poisoning requires careful measurement—not lethal in one dose, but lethal over days.
