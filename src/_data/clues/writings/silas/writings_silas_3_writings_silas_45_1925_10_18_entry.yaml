  ## Body of Cordelia Montrose — October 18, 1925

  Poisoning over time — **cumulative organ damage** consistent with gradual cardiotoxicity. Her kidneys show scarring from prolonged exposure to a toxin. This was slow poisoning, not a single lethal dose.

  A **sweet, herbal residue** on her lips — something she consumed regularly. If someone substituted a toxic ingredient into a daily preparation, small doses would accumulate over time.

  This kind of poisoning requires **careful measurement** — not lethal in one dose, but lethal over days. I suspect someone was monitoring her daily consumption.
