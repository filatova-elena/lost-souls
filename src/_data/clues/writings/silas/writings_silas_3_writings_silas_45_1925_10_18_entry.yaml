content: 'A messenger came to the mortuary this afternoon. Well-dressed. Set an envelope
  on my desk and left before I could open it.


  Cream-colored paper. Heavy stock. The kind wealthy families use. Inside - five hundred
  dollars, fresh from the bank. The note that said: ***"For your discretion."*** The
  Montroses. Who else. Three dead and someone wants to make sure the mortician keeps
  his mouth shut.


  Five hundred dollars. I could replace the roof. Buy Martha that icebox she''s been
  circling in the Sears catalog since September. Put something away for the children.


  The dead won''t mind.
