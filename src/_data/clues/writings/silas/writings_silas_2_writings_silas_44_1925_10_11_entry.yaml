  ## Body of Sebastian Crane — October 11, 1925

  Systematic organ failure. The pattern shows a poison that attacked **multiple systems over time**. Not quick. Not merciful. This was intentional and monitored.

  The organ damage is consistent with **cardiac glycoside poisoning** — foxglove or similar.

  **Chemical burns in the stomach lining.** Whatever killed Sebastian was delivered in liquid form.

  Sebastian was a pharmacist. Unlikely he would have ingested a poison accidentally. Suspicious.
