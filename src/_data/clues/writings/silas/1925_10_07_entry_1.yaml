character_interpretations:
  mortician: My ancestor documented what he saw with precision. The fracture pattern is unmistakable—impact from behind. The lack of defensive marks confirms she never saw it coming.
  town_doctor: As a physician, I can confirm the trauma pattern is inconsistent with accidental fall. The concentrated damage to back of head and spine suggests deliberate force. The broken arm in two places, not even trying to catch herself. This is murder.
