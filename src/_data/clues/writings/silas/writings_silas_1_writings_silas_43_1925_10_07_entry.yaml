content: "Alice Whitmore. Twenty-four. Delicate bone structure, the kind of face you\
  \ see on cameos. Lovely girl. Terrible skull fracture.\n\nSomeone had brushed her\
  \ hair forward before bringing her in. Tucked the curls just so, right over the\
  \ wound. Tender work. \n\nDr. Crane's certificate was already waiting on my desk.\
  \ \"Accidental fall.\" Fine by me. I don't write the paperwork.\n\nShe was easy\
  \ work, honestly. Young skin takes to preparation beautifully — holds color, doesn't\
  \ fight you.\n"
