  ## Body of Alice Whitmore — October 7, 1925

  The fracture pattern is unmistakable — **impact from behind**. Concentrated damage to the back of the head and spine. A single, deliberate strike.

  No defensive marks on the arms or hands. She never saw it coming.

  The right arm is **broken in two places**, yet there was no attempt to catch herself — she was already falling when the arm broke beneath her.

  The trauma pattern is **inconsistent with an accidental fall**. The damage suggests deliberate force. This was not an accident.
