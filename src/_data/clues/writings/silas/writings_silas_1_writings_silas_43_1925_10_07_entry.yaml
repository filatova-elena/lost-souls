  Alice Whitmore. Twenty-four. Delicate bone structure, the kind of face you see on cameos. Lovely girl. Terrible skull fracture.
  
  Someone had brushed her hair forward before bringing her in. Tucked the curls just so, right over the wound. Tender work. 
  
  Dr. Crane's certificate was already waiting on my desk. "Accidental fall." Fine by me. I don't write the paperwork.
  
  She was easy work, honestly. Young skin takes to preparation beautifully — holds color, doesn't fight you.
