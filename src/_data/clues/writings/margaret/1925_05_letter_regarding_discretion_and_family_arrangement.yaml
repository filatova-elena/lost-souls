  Cordelia,

  Your father and I have made arrangements for your... situation. The Sullivan family has agreed to accept the child as their own. This is a matter of significant discretion and consequence.

  You will remain away until such time as we determine it safe for you to return. A suitable story regarding European travel has been established. You will not deviate from this narrative under any circumstances. The reputations of this family—your siblings' marriage prospects, your father's business standing, our position in society—depend entirely on absolute silence.

  The child will be cared for. That should be sufficient consolation. You made your choice, and now we are managing the consequences of your indiscretion.

  The Sullivan family has agreed that periodic photographs may be sent, but under no circumstances are you to make contact, acknowledge the arrangement, or reveal your knowledge of the child's location. This is not negotiable. To do so would confirm what we have worked so carefully to conceal.

  Your duty now is to restore your reputation through a suitable marriage. We are pursuing several possibilities. You will cooperate fully with our efforts.

  Return when notified. Not before.

  Your Mother

  P.S. - Do not attempt to write to the child. Any correspondence will be destroyed.
