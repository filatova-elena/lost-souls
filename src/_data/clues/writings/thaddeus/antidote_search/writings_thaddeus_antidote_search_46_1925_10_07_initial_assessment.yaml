  Sebastian has ingested foxglove derivative. Dosage unknown but acute symptoms present. The compound can be managed with proper intervention. Cardiac glycosides respond to electrolyte management and cardiac support.

  First approach: Gastric lavage immediately to remove remaining toxin from digestive tract. High-dose potassium supplementation. Strict bed rest with cardiac monitoring.

  Second approach: Diuretics to increase urine output and flush toxin from system.

  This is manageable. I have handled toxin cases before. I am managing it.
