  [Handwriting deteriorating]

  Hawthorn strengthens heart tissue. Willow bark reduces inflammation. Combined with additional potassium and strychnine for cardiac stimulation.

  Dosed patient this morning. Monitoring continuously.

  [Hours later, same page]: NOTHING. No improvement. The heart continues to fail. Why doesn't the body respond to treatment?

  Unless the concentration of toxin is so extreme that my standard protocols cannot compete with it.

  Unless I am fundamentally misunderstanding something.
