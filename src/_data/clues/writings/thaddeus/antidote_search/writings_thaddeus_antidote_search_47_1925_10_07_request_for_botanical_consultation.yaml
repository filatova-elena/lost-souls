  Dear Professor Hartley,

  I write regarding a confidential medical matter. A patient has been exposed to concentrated foxglove derivative. I am formulating a counter-treatment and require your expertise on botanical remedies.

  Specifically: Are there plants or compounds known to counteract cardiac distress from digitalis poisoning? Any botanical knowledge that might provide cardiac support would be invaluable.

  Your discretion is appreciated.

  Dr. Thaddeus Crane
