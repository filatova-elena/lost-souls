  Sebastian's heart stopped this morning at 3 AM. I performed manual resuscitation. His heart resumed after five minutes. By some miracle.

  I have tried everything. Gastric lavage. Potassium supplementation. Strychnine. Nitroglycerin. Willow bark. Hawthorn. Diuretics. Venesection. Every treatment known to modern medicine.

  None of it works.

  I am a physician. I am supposed to SAVE LIVES. And I am watching my brother die, and I KNOW WHY but I cannot admit WHY and I cannot fix WHAT I HAVE DONE.

  Cordelia is also sick. She is deteriorating rapidly.
character_interpretations:
  doctor: His heart STOPPED. Thaddeus performed resuscitation and got it back. But 'I KNOW WHY but I cannot admit WHY'—this is confession.
  psychic: The breakdown is complete. 'I KNOW WHY' screams guilt. Not just medical guilt—criminal guilt.
  influencer: Thaddeus just admitted he POISONED Sebastian. And Cordelia. How many others?
  heiress: Uncle Thaddeus... what did he do?
  explorer: The Crane family poisoning wasn't accidental. Thaddeus KNOWS why this happened.
  others: A doctor just confessed to poisoning his brother and fiancée.
