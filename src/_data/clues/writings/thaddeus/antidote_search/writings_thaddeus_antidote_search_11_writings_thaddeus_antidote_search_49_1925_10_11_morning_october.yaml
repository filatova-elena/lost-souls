  Sebastian's heart stopped this morning at 3 AM. I performed manual resuscitation. His heart resumed after five minutes. By some miracle.

  I have tried everything. Gastric lavage. Potassium supplementation. Strychnine. Nitroglycerin. Willow bark. Hawthorn. Diuretics. Venesection. Every treatment known to modern medicine.

  None of it works.

  I am a physician. I am supposed to SAVE LIVES. And I am watching my brother die, and I KNOW WHY, I KNOW EXACTLY WHY, but I cannot fix it now.

  Cordelia is also sick. She is deteriorating rapidly.
