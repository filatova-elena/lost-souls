  My Dear Brother,

  I present to you this timepiece on the occasion of your engagement to Miss Montrose. It marks not merely the hours and minutes of our earthly existence, but something far more significant.

  Inside, I have had engraved the date of tomorrow's astronomical event—the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, a celestial alignment that occurs but once in a generation. The ancients believed such moments carried profound significance, marking the intersection of love and fortune.

  I thought it fitting that you should carry with you a record of this sacred timing. Let it remind you that some moments in life are written in the stars themselves.

  May your union be as harmonious as the heavens above.

  Your devoted brother,
  Thaddeus

  clockmaker: Wait—WAIT. This is IT. This is the watch. The pocket watch I've been restoring for YEARS. The one engraved with September 4 and the conjunction symbols. THIS CARD proves it. Thaddeus gave this to his brother as an engagement gift, engraved with the date of the Jupiter-Venus conjunction. September 4, 1925.
