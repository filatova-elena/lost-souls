  Patient attributes sleep disturbance to heightened sensitivity. Claims premonitions and psychic impressions. Her observations are remarkably accurate. 

  Dr. Morrison previously diagnosed acute hysteria. Prescribed bed rest, bromides, and the usual tedious regimen.
  
  My assessment is different. This is not hysteria. The medical establishment dismisses anything it cannot measure as female neurosis. But I have studied the work of the Society for Psychical Research, the experiments at Duke. There are documented cases of precognitive ability, of sensitivity beyond normal perception.
