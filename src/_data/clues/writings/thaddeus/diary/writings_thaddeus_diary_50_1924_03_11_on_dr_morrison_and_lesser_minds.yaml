content: The Morrison clinic is insufferable. Dr. Morrison is competent enough, I
  suppose, but his method lacks refinement. He approaches medicine as if it were mere
  carpentry—measuring, testing, building without vision. Medicine is art. It requires
  imagination, intuition, the kind of intellectual superiority that separates the
  truly great physicians from the merely adequate.
