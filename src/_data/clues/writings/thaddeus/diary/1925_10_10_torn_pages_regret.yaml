  I cannot continue this deception. I cannot. The weight of it is suffocating me. When Sebastian walked into my office today, pale and trembling, describing the very symptoms I knew he would describe, I felt something splinter inside me. This is what I have done. This.

  I have ruined him. Cordelia too. They will both suffer because of my arrogance, my resentment, my pathetic need to escape my brother's shadow. And for what? For Alice? For some imagined transformation of my circumstances? What have I become?

  Alice came to see me this evening. She knew something was wrong—she always knows. I could not lie to her. I told her everything. The formula. The foxglove. My intentions. My weakness.

  She listened in silence, and then she took my hands and said: "Thaddeus, you must confess. You must go to the authorities and tell them what you have done. You must save yourself before this destroys you completely."

  But I cannot confess. I cannot. If I do, everything ends. My reputation. My practice. My freedom. Perhaps my life itself. I tried to explain this to Alice, and she looked at me with such disappointment. Such contempt, even.

  "You murdered them," she said quietly. "Not with bravery. Not with conviction. But with cowardice. You did this terrible thing and now you lack the courage to face it."

  I told her she was wrong. That I had no choice. That circumstances forced my hand. But we both knew I was lying.

  [Final pages heavily crossed through]

  I am a coward. A murderer and a coward. This is what I am. This is what I have always been, beneath the veneer of superiority. Alice sees it now. She sees me clearly for the first time, and she is disgusted.

  I cannot confess. But I cannot live with this either. I am trapped between two impossible truths, and I have no path forward that does not end in destruction.
