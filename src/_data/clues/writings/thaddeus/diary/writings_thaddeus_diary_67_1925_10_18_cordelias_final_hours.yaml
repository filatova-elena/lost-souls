  Cordelia died this morning. The autopsy will show cardiac failure. Natural causes, it will be recorded. A young woman's heart giving out after her fiancé's sudden death — considering what she endured, it will surprise no one. I sat with her through her final hours. She was delirious with pain, confused, calling out for Sebastian. I administered morphine.

  Why did it have to come to this? Why did she have to suffer? All for the sake of appearances — societal expectations, propriety, reputation. Why couldn't Alice and I simply be left in peace? We loved each other. That should have been enough. They killed her. Society and its rigid, unforgiving judgment — they killed her.
