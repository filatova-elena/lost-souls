  [These pages are torn, water-stained, and marked with violent strikethrough. The handwriting deteriorates throughout, becoming increasingly frantic.]

  Alice came to see me this evening. She knew something was wrong—she always knows. I could not lie to her. I told her everything. The formula. The foxglove. My intentions.

  She listened in silence, and then she took my hands and said: "Thaddeus, you must confess. You must go to the authorities and tell them what you have done. There might still be time to save them."

  [Pages torn here]

  She didn't understand — there is no time! I tried everything with Sebastian, everything! And Cordelia? I must not intervene now.

  If I do, everything ends. My reputation. My practice. My freedom. Perhaps my life itself. I tried to explain this to Alice, and she looked at me with such disappointment. 

  I told her that I had no choice. That circumstances forced my hand. I spoke at length about the situation, about the kind of expectations that are placed on me. About all the good I wouldn't be able to do if I confessed. But even my brilliant Alice couldn't follow me there.

  [Final pages heavily crossed through]

  I cannot confess. No, I must not.
