  I cannot sleep. My hands will not stop trembling. I tell myself it is exhaustion from the clinic. But I know it is something else. Some moment of decision I have not yet fully acknowledged, even to myself.

  I lie awake considering possibilities. Hypothetically. Academically. What would be the most elegant approach?
