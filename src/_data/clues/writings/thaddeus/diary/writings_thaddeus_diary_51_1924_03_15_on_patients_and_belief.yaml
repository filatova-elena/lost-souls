content: I prescribed a new tonic for Mrs. Harrington today. She will attribute any improvement to my brilliance. Of course, the improvement comes from her own body's natural healing—but she will never understand this. People need to believe in their doctor. They need to feel their fate rests in superior hands. It is kinder this way.
