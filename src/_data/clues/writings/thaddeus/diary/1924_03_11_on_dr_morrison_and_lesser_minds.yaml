content: The Morrison clinic is insufferable. Dr. Morrison is competent enough, I suppose, but his method lacks refinement. He approaches medicine as if it were mere carpentry—measuring, testing, building without vision. Medicine is art. It requires imagination, intuition, the kind of intellectual superiority that separates the truly great physicians from the merely adequate.
