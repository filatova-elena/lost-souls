  Sebastian is dead.

  His heart simply... stopped. I was present when it happened. His breathing had become labored. His vision was nearly gone. And then his heart, damaged beyond capacity to continue, simply ceased its function.

  I stood there for a long moment, watching him. He is gone, the fool that he was.
