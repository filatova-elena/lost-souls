  I cannot stop thinking about her. About *me*.

  Mother says she loved me very much but couldn't keep me. That's all I know. That's all anyone will tell me.

  Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder whose face I'm seeing. Is it hers? Do I have her eyes, her hair? Mother says I do, but I'll never know for certain because I've never seen her. But I don't have her name. I don't have her story. I don't have the answer to the one question that matters: who am I really?

  And will I ever know?
