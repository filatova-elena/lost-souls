  Today I stood in the bakery kneading dough, and Mother complimented my technique. 'You have a gift for this,' she said. 'It's in your blood.'

  And I thought: which blood? The Sullivan blood, from the people who raised me? Or the blood of my birth parents?

  Mother taught me bread-making when I could barely reach the counter. This is the legacy I've been given.
