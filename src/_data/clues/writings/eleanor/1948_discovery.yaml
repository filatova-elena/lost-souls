  I was helping Mother organize the library when I found an old newspaper clipping. I wasn't looking for it—it fell from a book.

  The headline read: 'Local Pharmacist Engaged to Miss Cordelia Montrose - Society Wedding Planned.'

  There was a photograph. A woman in a garden, standing beside a man with intense eyes. The woman was the woman from my photographs. The same person.

  Cordelia Montrose.

  I looked up the name in the society pages. The Montrose family—wealthy, prominent, rigidly respectable. The woman who gave me life was born into privilege and secrets.

  I haven't told anyone what I found.
