  Mother gave me a small box today when I turned fifteen. She said I was old enough to understand. Inside were photographs—a woman with dark hair and sad eyes, beautiful in a way that made my chest ache.

  'This is your birth mother,' Mother explained. 'She loved you very much. She wasn't able to raise you, but she wanted you to know what she looked like. To know she hadn't forgotten.'

  Father looked uncomfortable. He left the room.

  I stared at the photograph for hours. The woman looked lonely. She looked like she was missing something essential.

  She looked like me.
