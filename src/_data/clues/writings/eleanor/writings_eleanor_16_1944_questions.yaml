  I'm old enough now to understand that families aren't always simple stories. Mother and Father won't tell me much about my birth mother—only that she was in difficult circumstances. That the arrangement was made with discretion and love.

  But I keep returning to the photographs. Trying to read the mystery in a woman's face. Trying to understand what circumstances were desperate enough to separate a mother from her daughter.

  Father says some people aren't meant to be together, no matter how much they love each other. The world is complicated.

  I'm beginning to understand he's right.
