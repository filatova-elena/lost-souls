  I'm old enough now to understand that families aren't always simple stories. Mother and Father won't tell me much, only that the arrangement was made with love and care.


  But I keep returning to the photographs. There is a strange ache in my heart I cannot explain when I look at them.


  Father says some people aren't meant to be together, no matter how much they love each other. The world is complicated.


  I'm beginning to understand he's right.
