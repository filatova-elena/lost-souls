title: Unusual Visit - The Brother
act: act_iii_investigation
content: Dr. Thaddeus Crane visited asking detailed questions about my consultations with Sebastian. What advice I'd given, which ingredients I'd approved, whether the formula was safe. Very methodical. I confirmed everything was appropriate, the concentrations safe, no hazardous interactions. He seemed disappointed by this answer. He pressed me specifically on whether the ginseng root could possibly produce harmful effects. I assured him it would be entirely inert. Strange fellow.
character_interpretations:
  mortician: Dr. Thaddeus was asking methodical questions about what would and wouldn't show up on examination at those concentrations. He was verifying the safety.
  town_doctor: My ancestor checked whether the botanical consultation would support his conclusions. He was verifying there were no obvious issues.
  fiduciary: Payment records show financial activity around this period. This visit shows Thaddeus was concerned about the documented formula.
  psychic_medium: Something was happening in this moment in history. A significant conversation with consequences.
  baker: A doctor asking technical questions about botanical safety. Not my area of expertise.
