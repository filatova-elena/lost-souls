  Dr. Thaddeus Crane visited asking detailed questions about my consultations with Sebastian. What advice I'd given, which ingredients I'd approved, whether the formula was safe. Very methodical. I confirmed everything was appropriate, the concentrations safe, no hazardous interactions. He seemed disappointed by this answer. He pressed me specifically on whether the ginseng root could possibly produce harmful effects. I assured him it would be entirely inert. Strange fellow.
