  Quite unusual. Sebastian Crane visited today—nephew to old Edmund Crane who donated those specimens for the garden wall in '19. Or was it '18? No matter. He came with botanical ingredients for his fiancée, rather earnest about the whole thing. Damiana, valerian, rose otto, potassium bromide—all harmless enough. I lectured him on storage conditions, perhaps more than necessary. He approved the formulation. Entirely harmless.
