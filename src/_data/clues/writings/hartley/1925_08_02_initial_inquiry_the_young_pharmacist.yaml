title: Initial Inquiry - The Young Pharmacist
content: Quite unusual. Sebastian Crane visited today—nephew to old Edmund Crane who donated those specimens for the garden wall in '19. Or was it '18? No matter. He came with botanical ingredients for his fiancée, rather earnest about the whole thing. Damiana, valerian, rose otto, potassium bromide—all harmless enough. I lectured him on storage conditions, perhaps more than necessary. He approved the formulation. Entirely harmless.
character_interpretations:
  botanist: Hartley's consultation records show he approved a completely legitimate romantic formula. All ingredients are correctly identified and safe at those concentrations. Sebastian was genuinely consulting on a harmless love potion attempt.
  mortician: The consultation records are detailed and thorough. Hartley verified the formula was safe. The documentation is professionally done.
  art_collector: The Romano family imported exotic botanicals through legitimate channels. If Hartley consulted on botanical sourcing, he might have documented what materials were available.
  town_doctor: Examining this historical consultation, Hartley's assessment is medically sound. At those concentrations, the formula is completely benign.
  fiduciary: Hartley's professional consultation is documented and legitimate. He verified all ingredients and concentrations carefully.
