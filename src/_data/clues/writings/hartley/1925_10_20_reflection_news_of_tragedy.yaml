  Sebastian Crane is dead. His fiancée as well. Cardiac failure, apparently.

  My consultations were purely botanical. The formula I approved was completely safe. I verified this repeatedly. All ingredients appropriate, all concentrations safe. It couldn't have been the formula.

  Though I do wonder why the doctor asked such specific questions about the mandrake's safety. As if he was searching for me to confirm something particular.

  The formula was safe. I verified this. Didn't I?
character_interpretations:
  mortician: Reading this historical reflection, Hartley is having doubts. He's reconsidering his own conclusions. Something about the aftermath is troubling him.
  prosecutor: Hartley's documented reflections show he verified the formula was safe. He was thorough. His later doubts are worth examining.
  town_doctor: My ancestor is troubled by something. The historical record shows he questioned his own assessment later. What changed his mind?
  fiduciary: The documentation shows Hartley approved the formula as safe. His later uncertainty is noteworthy from a legal standpoint.
  psychic_medium: Hartley is sensing something wrong. He's beginning to question. His intuition is telling him something doesn't match the official narrative.
  influencer: Hartley's documentation of the formula shows it was approved as harmless. His later doubts suggest he learned something that contradicted his initial assessment.
