act: act_ii_mystery_emerges
content: Young Crane returned, asking about ginseng root for 'symbolic value.' I explained it would be entirely inert at his proposed concentrations—merely ritual, no actual effect. He seemed concerned about whether such small amounts could be harmful in any scenario. I assured him repeatedly they could not. Lost track of time explaining the history of romantic botanicals. My assistant Jenkins looked quite pained.
character_interpretations:
  botanist: Hartley was asked about ginseng root at those concentrations. He explained it would be inert—merely ritual, no actual pharmacological effect. A reasonable consultation about botanical symbolism.
  mortician: The consultation addressed whether small concentrations would be harmful. Hartley assured Sebastian they could not be. He was thorough in his assessment.
  dressmaker: Sebastian was asking about what would and wouldn't be detectable. He was verifying the safety of the ingredients he planned to use.
  psychic_medium: Something significant happened in this consultation. Someone was being very careful about what they were asking.
  explorer: Hartley spent considerable time explaining botanical history and romantic traditions. This was serious consultation, not casual discussion.
