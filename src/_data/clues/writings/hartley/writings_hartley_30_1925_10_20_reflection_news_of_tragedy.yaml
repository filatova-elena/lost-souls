  Sebastian Crane is dead. His fiancée as well. Cardiac failure, apparently.

  My consultations were purely botanical. The formula I approved was completely safe. I verified this repeatedly. All ingredients appropriate, all concentrations safe. It couldn't have been the formula.

  Though I do wonder why the doctor asked such specific questions about the ginseng root's safety. As if he was searching for me to confirm something particular.

  The formula was safe. I verified this. Didn't I?
