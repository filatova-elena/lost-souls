title: Third Consultation - The Final Formula
content: Third visit. Crane presented his final formula with all components properly detailed. I verified each ingredient and concentration—completely sound, all ratios appropriate, no toxic components, no harmful interactions. I assured him his fiancée was fortunate to have someone so thoughtful. He brightened considerably. I did warn him about storage conditions. Multiple times, as I recall.
character_interpretations:
  town_doctor: Hartley's verification is thorough. He checked all ingredients, concentrations, and interactions. The documentation shows careful, methodical work.
  mortician: 'Hartley''s final assessment: everything checks out, all ratios appropriate, no toxic components, no harmful interactions. Professional and complete.'
  dressmaker: Hartley warned about storage conditions—temperature, humidity. He emphasized this multiple times. Storage matters for botanical preparations.
  fiduciary: Hartley's documentation is precise. This creates a documented record of what the formula was supposed to be at this point in time.
  influencer: I've been researching this consultation. September 4th was the Jupiter-Venus conjunction—significant astrologically. This consultation happened weeks before that date.
