  ## You observe

  Every single manifest includes items marked **"private delivery, contents unlisted"** at substantially higher valuations than the legitimate goods — $8,500, $12,000, $15,000, $20,000. Someone understood the art world well enough to **use legitimate art as camouflage**. The documented pieces give the manifests an air of legitimacy.
