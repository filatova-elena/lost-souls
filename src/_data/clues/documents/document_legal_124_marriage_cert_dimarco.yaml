  **YOU OBSERVE:**


  A woman appears in Reno in 1960 and then **disappears completely**. No death certificate, no property purchases, no further trail. Someone created Elena DiMarco as a **temporary identity** for a specific purpose, then shed it. The groom's name is redacted — someone wanted that relationship erased from records.


  This wasn't a marriage — this was a **financial transaction wearing a wedding certificate**. Asset transfer via marriage would explain the Nevada location — a community property state. The name **DiMarco** is **Italian**.
