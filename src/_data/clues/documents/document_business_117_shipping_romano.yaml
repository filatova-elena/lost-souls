  **YOU OBSERVE:**

  - **Belladonna** is a plant requiring very careful handling. Even small amounts can be dangerous if misused.

  - **Ginseng root** at 3 lbs is a significant investment. Imported ginseng was expensive and highly sought after — this quantity suggests either a wealthy clientele or someone stockpiling a valuable commodity.

  - **Foxglove** appears in two of the three shipments — first as dried plant material, then as seeds. Used as a cardiac remedy in the 1920s.  Toxic in high doses.
