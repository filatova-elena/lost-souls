  \ 5 lbs\n  - Consignee: S. Crane, 718 Myrtle Ave\n\n---\n\n**YOU OBSERVE:**\n\n\
  - **Belladonna** is a plant requiring very careful handling. Even small amounts\
  \ can be dangerous if misused.\n\n- **Ginseng root** at 3 lbs is a significant investment.\
  \ Imported ginseng was expensive and highly sought after — this quantity suggests\
  \ either a wealthy clientele or someone stockpiling a valuable commodity.\n\n- **Foxglove**\
  \ appears in two of the three shipments — first as dried plant material, then as\
  \ seeds. Used as a cardiac remedy in the 1920s.  Toxic in high doses."
