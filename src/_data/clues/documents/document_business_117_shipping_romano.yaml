character_interpretations:
  professor: Harbor Import & Trading supplied Sebastian with botanical specimens and digitalis materials between August and October 1924. My ancestor's consultation records from that same period document someone asking detailed questions about digitalis purpurea extraction, dosing, and preparation. The timing aligns perfectly. The question isn't whether Sebastian ordered these materials—the manifests confirm it. The question is what he intended to do with them.
  art_collector: My family's company—Harbor Import & Trading—supplied Sebastian Crane with botanical materials including digitalis and foxglove. We also supplied the Montrose Estate with fine art, sculpture, and antiques. The manifests show regular shipments of legitimate goods to various clients. But I've seen how my family conducted business. They didn't ask questions about what customers did with the materials once they arrived.
  doctor: The shipping records show that Sebastian Crane ordered botanical specimens, including digitalis materials, through Harbor Import & Trading between August and October 1924. These were legitimate pharmaceutical supplies for an apothecary. The manifests are straightforward business transactions. But I'm a doctor, and I understand what digitalis is capable of. Someone with access to these materials, and knowledge of Sebastian's work, could have obtained what they needed from his own shipments.
  explorer: 'Following the supply chain: Harbor Import & Trading operated out of Long Beach, managed by Frankie Romano. They imported botanical specimens and fine goods from European suppliers. Sebastian Crane placed orders for pharmaceutical materials. The Montrose Estate received shipments of art and antiques. All documented, all traceable. The question is: who had access to these shipments after they arrived, and what did they do with them?'
  fiduciary: Harbor Import & Trading Company's records show normal commercial transactions. Shipments to Sebastian Crane for pharmaceutical supplies (August-October 1924). Shipments to the Montrose Estate for art and household items (ongoing). Everything documented, dated, itemized. The financial transactions appear standard for an import business. The goods themselves—botanical specimens, artwork, antiques—are all legitimate merchandise.
