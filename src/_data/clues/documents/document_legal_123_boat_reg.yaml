  - **La Stella Nuova** is Italian for "The New Star."


  - The sale in **1968** to an anonymous buyer is unusual. Private vessel sales in this era typically included full buyer documentation.


  - The **1965 maintenance records** show three consecutive months of structural work, focused heavily on the cargo hold. That's unusual for a pleasure vessel.
