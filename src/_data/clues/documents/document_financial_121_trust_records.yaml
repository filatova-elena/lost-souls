  ## The Incentive Structure

  **Thaddeus Crane** is positioned as temporary guardian — essentially **controller** — of a half-million-dollar estate if Eleanor Sullivan cannot be located. Three deaths in October 1925, and suddenly the entire inheritance hinges on Eleanor being found or not.

  Ninety days to locate an illegitimate child given away at birth — a nearly impossible task. If Eleanor can't be found, Thaddeus Crane gains guardianship of the largest unclaimed estate in the county.

  The question is unavoidable: **would someone work to keep Eleanor hidden?**
