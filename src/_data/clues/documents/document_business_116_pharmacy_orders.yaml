  \ Crane, Proprietor\n\n---\n\n**YOU OBSERVE:**\n\n- **Grain Alcohol (95%)** — 10\
  \ gallons is a substantial quantity during Prohibition. This could supply a small\
  \ speakeasy or suggest someone is running liquor under the guise of medicinal sales.\n\
  \n- **Digitalis (Foxglove)** appears twice: 4 ounces in August and 2 ounces in September.\
  \ Digitalis was a common cardiac remedy in the 1920s, but these quantities seem\
  \ high for a small operation.\n\n- **Potassium Bromide** was a widely used sedative,\
  \ but it was also falling out of medical favor by the mid-1920s due to reports of\
  \ chronic toxicity. An unusual choice for a reputable practitioner.\n\n- **Damiana\
  \ leaf** and **Rose Otto oil** together suggest someone was perhaps formulating\
  \ an aphrodisiac tonic — a popular but disreputable product in this era."
