  **YOU OBSERVE:**

  - **Grain Alcohol (95%)** — 10 gallons is a substantial quantity during Prohibition. This could supply a small speakeasy or suggest someone is running liquor under the guise of medicinal sales.

  - **Digitalis (Foxglove)** appears twice: 4 ounces in August and 2 ounces in September. Digitalis was a common cardiac remedy in the 1920s, but these quantities seem high for a small operation.

  - **Potassium Bromide** was a widely used sedative, but it was also falling out of medical favor by the mid-1920s due to reports of chronic toxicity. An unusual choice for a reputable practitioner.

  - **Damiana leaf** and **Rose Otto oil** together suggest someone was perhaps formulating an aphrodisiac tonic — a popular but disreputable product in this era.
