  All significant wire transfer activity visible in fragments ceases after 1967\n\
  Multiple international transfers documented\nSwiss banking references appear in\
  \ fragments\n\n---\n\n**YOU OBSERVE:**\n\nThese fragments show **systematic asset\
  \ liquidation and offshore transfer** between 1965–1967. Switzerland banking references,\
  \ coded recipients, progressive redaction of information. This wasn't random — it\
  \ was **planned financial architecture**.\n\nThe amounts are substantial — multiple\
  \ millions based on the redactions. \"Inheritance Transfer\" to Switzerland, \"\
  CA Estate\" wire transfers, \"Private Trust\" accounts. \n\nCould be connected to\
  \ the Romano's hidden fortune."
