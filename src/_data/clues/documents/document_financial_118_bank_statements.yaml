  Multiple international transfers documented
  Swiss banking references appear in fragments

  ---

  **YOU OBSERVE:**

  These fragments show **systematic asset liquidation and offshore transfer** between 1965–1967. Switzerland banking references, coded recipients, progressive redaction of information. This wasn't random — it was **planned financial architecture**.

  The amounts are substantial — multiple millions based on the redactions. "Inheritance Transfer" to Switzerland, "CA Estate" wire transfers, "Private Trust" accounts. 

  Could be connected to the Romano's hidden fortune.
