  **YOU OBSERVE:**

  The Crane family name has become associated with historical controversies and family stigma stemming from events in 1925. It makes sense they would seek to distance themselves from this history by changing their name. Dr. Lawrence Crane Jr.! Despite the name change, he still chose to follow in his father's footsteps and become a doctor.
