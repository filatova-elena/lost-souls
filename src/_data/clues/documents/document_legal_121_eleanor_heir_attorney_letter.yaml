   Mr. & Mrs. Harold J. Montrose

   **RE: Custodial Arrangement for Minor Child — Estate of Cordelia M. Montrose (d. October 17, 1925)**

   Dear Mr. and Mrs. Montrose,

   This is now my third letter on this matter. I will be direct. The child born to Cordelia on June 28, 1925 — registered as Eleanor, L.A. County File No. 1925-07834 — was placed with Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan of East Third Street. In the eyes of the law, Eleanor remains Cordelia's daughter and a direct lineal descendant of the Montrose family. Her claim to the estate supersedes all collateral relations.

   I have the adoption papers prepared. The process would be handled quietly through my office. But if you continue to ignore this, I must warn you — when your own estate is eventually settled, this will surface.

   Very truly yours,

   *Arthur R. Harwick, Esq.*
