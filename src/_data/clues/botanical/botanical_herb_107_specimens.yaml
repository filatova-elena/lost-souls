  Multiple glass jars containing dried plant materials — leaves, roots, flowers, seeds. Various colors and textures. The preservation methods are careful and the organization methodical, suggesting systematic botanical study and research. Someone was building a reference collection with serious knowledge. The care taken shows this was not casual — it was deliberate, cataloged botanical work.
