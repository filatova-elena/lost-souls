  **Stinging Nettle [Urtica dioica]**. An overgrown patch with distinctive stinging hairs on the leaves and stems. Grows wild in a forgotten corner. Common medicinal herb with high mineral content — good for tea, though bitter and astringent. The roots contain compounds beneficial for health. The old gardener's log mentions medicinal benefits, and Dr. Thaddeus ordered nettle tea during this period.
