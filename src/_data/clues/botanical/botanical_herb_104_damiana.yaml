  **Damiana [Turnera diffusa]**. Dried leaves and flower fragments in a bottle. Yellowish, with a minty and slightly bitter smell. The tropical origin and dried leaf structure indicate sophisticated sourcing — requires warm climate cultivation. Whoever obtained this knew exactly what they were looking for. Non-toxic in small doses.
