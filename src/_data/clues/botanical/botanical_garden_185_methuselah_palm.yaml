  **Washingtonia robusta** — Mexican Fan Palm

  A towering specimen, likely planted when the house was built in the early 1900s. *Washingtonia robusta* is native to the desert canyons of Baja California and Sonora, Mexico, where specimens have been documented exceeding 500 years of age. The species was prized by wealthy Southern California homeowners as a symbol of tropical elegance and permanence.

  The trunk is slender and slightly curved, topped by a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves. Dead fronds hang below the crown in a characteristic "petticoat" skirt. The bark is rough and fibrous, deeply fissured with age.

  This specimen is nicknamed **"Methuselah"** after the Biblical patriarch said to have lived 969 years. At over a century old, it is likely one of the oldest living things on the property.
