content: '**Grain Alcohol, 95% [Ethanol, C₂H₅OH]**. A clear, colorless liquid. Very
  strong smell. Obviously high-proof spirits. An excellent solvent and preservative
  — the high proof indicates serious pharmaceutical work, not amateur tinctures. During
  Prohibition, challnging to source legally.
