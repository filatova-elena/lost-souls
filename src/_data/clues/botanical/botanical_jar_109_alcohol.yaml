  **Grain Alcohol, 95% [Ethanol, C₂H₅OH]**. A clear, colorless liquid. Very strong smell. Obviously high-proof spirits. An excellent solvent and preservative — the high proof indicates serious pharmaceutical work, not amateur tinctures. During Prohibition, someone with serious underworld connections sourced this. Not acquired legally.
