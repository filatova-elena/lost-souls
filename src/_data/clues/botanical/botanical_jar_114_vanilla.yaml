  **Vanilla, Cherry Syrup, Honey [Vanilla planifolia / Prunus / Apis mellifera]**. Amber-colored syrup. Sweet, aromatic smell. Good quality vanilla, proper cherry syrup, real honey — designed to mask bitter botanicals. These flavorings would completely disguise herbal bitterness, making any preparation palatable. Someone knew how to balance flavors.
