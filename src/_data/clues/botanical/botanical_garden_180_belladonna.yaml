  *Atropa belladonna.* A bushy, unassuming plant — dull green leaves, drooping bell-shaped flowers of purple-brown, and clusters of **glossy black berries** that look, to the untrained eye, rather inviting. Children have been known to eat them. It does not end well.

  The name itself is a curiosity. *Bella donna* — "beautiful woman." Renaissance ladies used drops of belladonna extract to **dilate their pupils**, making their eyes appear larger, darker, more alluring. Vanity has always had a complicated relationship with poison.

  The active compounds — **atropine, scopolamine, hyoscyamine** — are anticholinergics. They block the parasympathetic nervous system entirely. In the 1920s, atropine was a standard pharmaceutical: used to dilate pupils for eye examinations, to dry secretions before surgery, to treat bradycardia. Every apothecary would stock it.

  The old medical students' mnemonic for anticholinergic poisoning is rather vivid:

  - **Hot** as a hare — flushed, feverish skin
  - **Dry** as a bone — no tears, no saliva, no sweat
  - **Red** as a beet — the face flushes crimson
  - **Blind** as a bat — pupils dilated beyond function
  - **Mad** as a hatter — hallucinations, delirium, agitation

  In higher doses: **convulsions, respiratory failure, death**.

  Grows rather well in this climate, I must say. One finds it in the most unexpected gardens.
