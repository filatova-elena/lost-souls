  **Rose Otto [Rosa × damascena]**. A small bottle of precious oil. Deep, complex floral aroma — intense and luxurious. Pure, not cut or adulterated. The quality is exceptional — genuine Ottoman or Bulgarian distillation. Extremely expensive. Someone paid dearly for this and meant something special by it.
