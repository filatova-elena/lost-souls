  **SULLIVAN'S BAKERY**, a Long Beach institution for nearly fifty years, burned to the ground late last night in a fire that left **two dead** and raised troubling questions about the blaze's origin. The bodies have been identified as **David Sullivan**, 38, owner of the bakery, and **Catherine Sullivan**, 36, his wife.

  Reports state the Sullivans had an **infant child**, though **no body has been recovered** despite extensive searches of the ruins.

  Fire Marshal David Chen stated: "The fire spread with unusual rapidity. The preliminary finding is electrical wiring failure."

  **Accelerant patterns** were noted by responding firefighters, and one neighbor reported seeing an **unidentified figure fleeing** the building in the darkness.

  Sullivan's Bakery had operated continuously since 1942, founded by **Eleanor Sullivan** and famous for the family's **rose bread recipe** passed down through generations. The timing is notable: this fire occurs just as new interest in the 1925 Montrose mystery has surfaced. The official investigation concludes electrical failure, yet questions linger about the accelerant evidence and the Sullivan family connection to those historical events.
