  **THOMAS REED**, 69, was arrested yesterday evening at a property in Inland Empire on charges including grand theft, extortion, and property destruction. The Long Beach Police Department declined to detail specific charges, citing ongoing investigation.

  "Mr. Reed has had a long history of criminal activity," Detective William Castellano stated. "We've been monitoring him for some time. When the opportunity arose, we acted."

  Reed's background includes suspected involvement in illegal contracting work, intimidation, and various insurance-related schemes. A **1989 warehouse fire** in the harbor district is being examined in connection with the investigation, though authorities have not confirmed Reed's involvement.

  "We're looking at several incidents," Castellano said, "but at this point our focus is on current charges."

  Reed was discovered **living under an assumed name**. His associates remain unknown. The property where he was arrested contained tools, cash, and documentation investigators are still reviewing.

  Reed has refused to cooperate with questioning, requesting an attorney immediately upon arrest. The investigation remains ongoing.
