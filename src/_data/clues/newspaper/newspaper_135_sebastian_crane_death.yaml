  **SEBASTIAN CRANE**, 30, proprietor of Crane's Pharmaceutical Preparations on Ocean Boulevard, was found dead yesterday morning in his laboratory. Medical examiners initially attributed death to **acute cardiac failure**, but preliminary toxicology findings have raised **suspicions of poisoning**.

  Several witnesses report a **heated altercation** between Mr. Crane and **Frankie Romano**, the notorious shipping magnate, at the harbor docks two weeks prior. Romano's reputation for ruthless business dealings is well-established in maritime circles, and dock foreman Gerald Hutchins stated: "Crane was trying to back out of some arrangement. Romano doesn't take kindly to quitters."

  Mr. Crane's involvement in dubious pharmaceutical enterprises has been whispered about in certain quarters for some time. A source close to the **Montrose family** stated: "He had connections to the import business — the kind of imports that don't always come through official channels."

  Federal investigators have taken preliminary interest in Mr. Crane's business records and the **suspicious substances** found in his laboratory. The cause of death remains unclear. Was the young man the victim of mob retaliation? Or did his own pharmaceutical experiments prove fatal?
