    Rare exception - Used in vision clues to indicate which character the vision is meant for.
    Format: is_character_[character_name].
    Examples: is_character_doctor, is_character_explorer, is_character_dressmaker.
    These are NOT standard skills and should only be used in rare cases where a vision needs to be character-specific rather than skill-based.
