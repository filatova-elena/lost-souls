romano_dynasty:
  type: story_arc

romano_treasure:

cordelia_montrose:
  type: character
  description: |
    The romantic dreamer at the center of everything — a sheltered heiress who fell in love twice, bore a secret child, lost everyone she cared about, and died slowly without ever knowing why. Her final thoughts were of the daughter she never got to hold.

margaret_montrose:
  type: character
  description: |
    Cordelia's mother — the iron will behind the Montrose reputation. Arranged the secret adoption, managed the scandal, protected the family name at any cost. The kind of love that looks like cruelty.

alice_whitmore:
  type: character
  description: |
    The psychic who saw everything except her own death. Brilliant, gifted, dismissed as hysterical by everyone but the man who would kill her. She loved too deeply, trusted the wrong person, and became the restless spirit that wouldn't stop calling.

thomas_whitmore:
  type: character
  description: |
    The sailor who never came home in time — Cordelia's first love, Alice's brother, the merchant marine who was reported dead at sea but returned in 1926 to find everyone gone. He sailed away and never looked back. But his bloodline didn't end.

sebastian_crane:

thaddeus_crane:

frankie_romano:
  type: character

    "The Coast" — the rum runner who controlled everything moving through Long Beach harbor during Prohibition. Ruthless, connected, loud. Everyone blamed him for Sebastian's death. He didn't do it. But he's not innocent either.

elias_monroe:
  type: character

silas_blackwell:
  type: character
  description: |
    The mortician who knew the truth and took the money anyway. Three bodies, three lies on the death certificates, $500 in his safe, and private notes hidden in the family archives. The dead were already dead, and he had a family to feed.

celestine_laveau:
  type: character
  description: |
    The world-famous French psychic who could help everyone except the one who mattered most. She recognized Alice's gift, tried to mentor her, and spent her remaining years failing to free Alice's trapped spirit. Died in 1947 with unfinished business.

eleanor_sullivan:
  type: character
  description: |
    Cordelia's secret daughter — given away at birth, raised by the Sullivan family, never knowing her true origins. She baked rose bread every day of her life, her only connection to a mother she'd never meet. The link between the Montrose fortune and the Baker.

edmund_hartley:
  type: character

  description: |
    Célestine's great-great-granddaughter — carrying the family name, the gift, and a century of unfinished business. Alice Whitmore has been calling the Laveau line for 100 years. Margo is the one who finally answers.

catherine_sullivan:
  type: character
  description: |
    The Baker's mother — age 36, killed in the fire. Her last act: tucking Eleanor's diary into the baby's blankets while pleading for her child's life. The arsonist took the baby but never noticed the diary. Catherine's final gift saved the family's identity.

elena_dimarco:
  type: character
  description: |
    A ghost identity — a woman who appeared in Reno in 1960, married someone whose name was redacted, then vanished completely. No death certificate, no property trail, nothing.

venetian_bottle:
  type: object
  description: |
    The Venetian glass bottle — smuggled through Frankie's operation, chosen by Sebastian because his elixir deserved a container as beautiful as the love it was meant to create. A bootlegger's contraband that became a romantic's chalice, and the last piece of the Romano legacy the Art Collector couldn't sell.

pocket_watch_mystery:
  type: story_arc
  description: |
    The pocket watch mystery — a gold-plated timepiece engraved with the Jupiter-Venus conjunction of September 4, 1925.

The Clockmaker's obsession with this watch led them to the Montrose mansion and the truth behind three deaths.

# ===========================
# Botanicals
# ===========================

foxglove:
  description: |
    Digitalis purpurea — the beautiful garden plant that killed three people. A routine medicine in the 1920s doctor's cabinet, deadly when the dose crosses the line. Thaddeus knew exactly where that line was.

ginseng:
  description: |
    The missing piece — the rare Korean root Sebastian spent years searching for. The binding agent for eternal love, three thousand years of Chinese medicine distilled into the smallest pinch. It completed the formula. The formula that killed him.
