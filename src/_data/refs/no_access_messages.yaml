# HOW IT WORKS:
#   1. For each missing skill on a clue, pick a random phrase from skill_phrases
#   2. Join with Oxford-comma "or"
#   3. Look up wrappers by exact clue type string (e.g. "Artifact (Painting)")
#   4. Fall back to _default if no match
#   5. Pick a random wrapper, replace {requirements}
#
# EXAMPLE (Rose Garden Bed, type: "Botanical (Garden Herb)"):

#   phrases: ["a historian", "someone with botanical training", "a Romano family insider"]
#   wrapper: "The soil has stories to tell, but not to you. You'd need {requirements}."
#   result: "The soil has stories to tell, but not to you. You'd need a historian,
#            someone with botanical training, or a Romano family insider."
