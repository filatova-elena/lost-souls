  directions: |
    Guests arrive and are greeted by the host (could be G.G. or someone else)

    - dialogue:
        speaker: Host
        text: "Welcome, we've been expecting you!"
    - dialogue:
        speaker: Host
        text: "Please select your calling card."

        speaker: Host
        text: "Scan the QR code to read about the past you've forgotten"
  required_characters:
    - The Baker
    - The Heiress
    - The Fiduciary
    - The Art Collector
    - The Town Doctor
    - The Explorer
  notes: |
    Wait for people to gather first. Only lay out as many cards as there are people, ensuring someone picks each required character. When someone chooses The Baker character, the host gives them a basket with freshly baked rose bread. We must ensure someone picks the Baker - if necessary, assign that character before welcoming them into the foyer.

        As guests arrive into the foyer, there is a sign-in book with another QR code they should scan. This validates that their character is working as expected. Feedback example: "Signed in as the art collector of Long Beach, CA" Give them a few more minutes to settle in.

        text: |
          Welcome, friends! Thank you for gathering here today! As you may have heard, the spirits who have been haunting the rooms of this house for a century have been restless lately. The Heiress (can call out to the Heiress character) moved in and realized there is company. The Heartbroken Ghost can often be seen weeping by the upstairs bay window, The Lonely Ghost wandering the gardens in search of her friend, and The Ghost known as The Cursed Alchemist, tinkering in his laboratory.

        speaker: G.G.
        text: |
          Something terrible happened in October of 1925: three young people died in the short span of 11 days, all connected to this mansion in one way or another. They have been haunting its halls ever since. Help us solve the century-old mystery and release these spirits!
    - dialogue:
        speaker: G.G.
        text: |
          Each of you are here for a reason, because you too are connected to this mansion whether you know it yet or not. On your calling cards, note you have a primary objective, towards which you all will be working together, and a private objective, which might be different for each of you.

        speaker: G.G.

          Walk around the house, scan the clues, and work together. For some of the clues you will require an expert or a person with a personal connection to the item. Contact them promptly. Do not touch anything unless you see this symbol when you scan a clue: 🖐️
    - dialogue:
        speaker: G.G.
        text: |
          Your first quest is to find one of four objects important to our investigation, so we can send them for forensic analysis: a Venetian glass bottle, an antique pocket watch, a wedding dress fragment that belonged to the Heartbroken Ghost (we think), and Ginseng root that The Alchemist sometimes wanders in search of. Scan the clues to make sure you have the right one before you bring it to us, and look out for 🖐️

        speaker: G.G.
        text: "When you hear a bell (rings a bell), gather back in the dining room."

    - directions: |
        G.G. opens the sliding doors that lead to the dining room.
        [OPTIONAL] As guests enter the dining room, they see: The Ghost of The Alchemist, calling out to someone named "Cordelia" - "Cordelia, forgive me!" On the other side, the ghost of Cordelia glides slowly, her eyes dreamy and detached, not noticing the alchemist. They disappear into the kitchens (and then upstairs)
        G.G. waits for investigators to return by the dining room table. When all 4 items are gathered, rings the bell (can additionally use the PA system to call everyone back)

          Help us paint a picture of what happened to Cordelia. How did she die?

She was poisoned with a foxglove-laced elixir and died after days of accumulated toxin damage)
    - dialogue:
        speaker: G.G.
        text: |
          What happened to Sebastian? How did he meet his end? (Answer: Sebastian got suspicious when he noticed Cordelia was getting sicker and he tested the elixir on himself. He died of acute poisoning within days)

          What happened to Alice? How did she die? (Answer: Thaddeus confessed to her the truth, but when Alice urged him to make it public, he felt threatened. She was murdered with a silver candle holder and staged as an accidental fall)
