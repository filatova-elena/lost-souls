  "I have gathered you all here today for a very special reason," Grandmother spoke, her voice carrying through the dusty drawing room of the Montrose mansion. "Three souls have been trapped in this house for a century. It is time they were set free."

  Grandmother, as everyone called her, was a well-known, influential, and slightly feared figure in Long Beach—a woman who seemed to have connections everywhere. And it was no wonder she was the one leading the investigation at the Montrose mansion.

  When the Heiress reached out to the psychic, Margo Laveau, from a renowned family of spiritualists going back to the world-famous Celestine Laveau, word spread quickly. An investigation at the Montrose mansion attracted a diverse set of seekers.

  Grandmother looked around the assembled group—believers and skeptics, descendants of the victims and the accused, scientists and spiritualists. Each carried pieces of the puzzle. Each held secrets of their own.
