location: Montrose Mansion
content: 'The letter arrived on a Tuesday morning, embossed with the seal of a generational
  wealth management firm.


  "Miss Montrose,


  We are writing to inform you that you are the heir to the Montrose family estate
  located in Long Beach, California. The property has been held
  in trust for several decades, and our records indicate you are the closest living
  relative with a legal claim..."


  The Heiress—tired of her overbearing family, hungry for independence—saw opportunity.
  A mansion of her own? In Long Beach? How glamorous. How perfect. How bad could it
  be?


  The Fiduciary who tracked her down was thorough, pedantic, obsessed with proper
  documentation. They''d been managing the Montrose, Crane, and Whitmore estates for
  years. The mansion had been an eyesore, a wasted asset, abandoned for decades. If
  they could get someone to finally claim it, perhaps they could close this particular
  chapter of frustration.


  So the Heiress moved in, expecting elegance and independence.


  She discovered, instead, that she was not alone.'
