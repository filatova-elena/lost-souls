  The Professor made his way through the overgrown grounds of the mansion, examining the botanical specimens with professional interest. A patch of colorful ornamental peppers. An ancient rose garden, still blooming despite decades of neglect. And then—tucked behind a tangle of jasmine vines—a small outbuilding.

  The door opened with a rusty creak.

  The Professor stepped inside and stopped, his pulse quickening with recognition.

  A laboratory. Abandoned for a century, but unmistakably a laboratory.

  Workbenches lined the walls, covered in dust and cobwebs. Glass bottles and amber jars stood in neat rows, their contents long dried or evaporated. A brass balance scale sat in the corner. Bunsen burners. Distillation equipment. This had been a serious workspace.

  The Professor moved from jar to jar, reading faded labels, opening stoppers to smell the contents.

  **Rose otto**. The Professor inhaled deeply. That characteristic floral intensity, even after all these years.

  **Damiana**. Unmistakable. The dried leaves still held their distinctive scent.

  He picked up another jar and examined the gnarled root inside. **Ginseng**. Korean, if he weren't mistaken. Incredibly rare and expensive in the 1920s.

  **Valerian root**. The Professor recognized its sharp, almost unpleasant medicinal smell.

  And over here—**vanilla extract**, **honey**, **cherry syrup**. Flavorings.

  "Someone was making a tonic," the Professor murmured. "These were popular in the 1920s. Sold as cure-alls, tonics for vigor and vitality."

  Then he spotted the large glass carboys in the corner, still half-full of clear liquid.

  **Grain alcohol**.

  The Professor's eyebrows rose. "During Prohibition. This much would have required serious connections." He examined the setup more carefully. "Unless... yes. Under the medicinal tonic cover. These were legal for pharmaceutical use."

  On the main workbench, the Professor found scattered papers—some torn, some water-stained, but remarkably preserved in the dry shed. Notes in cramped handwriting. Calculations. Crossed-out formulas.

  He picked up a page at random and read:

  ***First principles: What is love but chemistry? The ancients understood—Venus and desire, the movement of blood...***

  "A poet chemist?" the Professor muttered. "Curious."

  More pages revealed obsessive refinements of a formula. Ratios adjusted. Ingredients added and crossed out. The handwriting grew more frantic in later entries.

  Then the Professor found it—a final page, more elaborate than the others. At the top, carefully drawn symbols: planets, constellations, astrological signs arranged in a specific pattern. It looked ritualistic. Almost ominous.

  Below the symbols, written in clear, confident script: ...
