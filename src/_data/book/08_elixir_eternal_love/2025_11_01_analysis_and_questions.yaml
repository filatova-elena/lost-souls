  Dr. Sinclair entered the dusty laboratory, her medical bag in hand. She'd been examining the house's old medicine cabinet when the Professor summoned her.

  "What do you make of this?" The Professor handed over the formula.

  Dr. Sinclair read it carefully, her expression growing more serious with each line. "Someone was making a love potion. An 'Elixir of Eternal Love.'" She looked up. "Given that Sebastian Crane died of suspected poisoning, this is... troubling."

  "But look at the ingredients," the Professor said. "I've examined every botanical component. They're all completely harmless. Common tonic ingredients, actually. What's your medical opinion on the chemical compounds?"

  Dr. Sinclair studied the formula again. "**Potassium bromide** was used as a sedative—perfectly legal in the 1920s. **Calcium lactate** for fortification. **Iron citrate** as a blood tonic. All standard medicinal ingredients." She frowned. "Individually, none of these would be toxic. Even in combination, at these dosages... I don't see how this could kill anyone."

  "So it's safe?"

  "In theory." Dr. Sinclair's frown deepened. "But Professor, could any of these botanicals become toxic when combined? Some plants have strange interactions."

  The Professor considered this carefully. He picked up the jar of **ginseng**, examining it in the dim light. "In my professional opinion? No. These botanicals don't interact dangerously. **Valerian** might enhance the sedative effect of the **bromide** slightly, but not lethally."

  "Then this formula is harmless?"

  "This formula, yes." The Professor set down the jar and met Dr. Sinclair's eyes. "But perhaps this isn't the final formula. Perhaps there was another version. Something more... potent."

  They both looked around the laboratory—at the rows of jars, the scattered papers, the evidence of obsessive experimentation.

  Somewhere in this room might be the real answer. The formula that had killed Sebastian Crane. And possibly others.

  Dr. Sinclair pulled out her phone. "We need to tell Grandmother about this. And we need to find out if there are more formulas hidden here."

  The Professor nodded, already moving toward the other shelves, other papers.
