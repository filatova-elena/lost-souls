  *He came to the garden this afternoon. Sebastian Crane. I've heard of him—the apothecary with the reputation for eccentricity. But seeing him is different than hearing about him. There's something in his eyes. A kind of wonder, as if he's looking at the world and seeing poetry where others see only facts.*

  *He asked me about the roses. Not their names or their botanical properties, but what I felt when I looked at them. No one has asked me that in years.*

  *Thomas used to ask me questions like that.*

  ***

  ***He spoke of chemistry and soul,***

  ***And how to make my spirit whole***

  ***Dark eyes that hold strange fire,***

  ***A smile that knows forbidden things,***

  ***He makes me feel something like desire,***

  ***But different—quieter—with careful wings.***
