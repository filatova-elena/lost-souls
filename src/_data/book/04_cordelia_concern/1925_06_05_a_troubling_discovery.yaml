  ![Thaddeus and Alice in the garden](../assets/garden_thaddeus_alice.png)

  *I could not believe what I saw today.*

  *After visiting Alice, I passed by the Whitmore garden on my way home. And there they were: Alice and Dr. Thaddeus Crane. Together. Walking arm in arm among the hedges, his head bent close to hers as if sharing secrets.*

  *Dr. Thaddeus Crane—Sebastian's brother, of all people! The respected physician, the pillar of Long Beach society.*

  *What is he doing with Alice?*

  *She's his patient. She's fragile, so terribly fragile since Thomas's death. Everyone says she's been having "episodes"—nightmares, fits of hysteria. She needs care, protection, not... whatever this is.*

  *A doctor and his patient—it's completely, utterly inappropriate.*

  *There was something in the way he looked at her. Something proprietary. As if she belonged to him.*

  *Sebastian speaks so highly of his brother—the brilliant doctor, the accomplished physician. But I've seen the way Thaddeus looks at people, as if he's studying specimens rather than seeing souls.*

  *I must find out what Dr. Crane's intentions are.*

  *I won't fail Alice again.*
