title: A Difficult Conversation
location: Whitmore House
content: 'As Cordelia approached the Whitmore house on Pine Avenue, a flood of memories
  rushed over her: youthful afternoons with Alice, their laughter unburdened and free.
  Late evening conversations about poetry and dreams.


  And then—there, on those very front steps—meeting Thomas for the first time. His
  sun-bronzed face, his impossible blue eyes, his easy smile.


  Cordelia swallowed hard, forcing back tears. No. She was here for Alice. This wasn''t
  about her own ghosts.


  Alice opened the door, surprise flickering across her pale face. "Cordelia? I wasn''t
  expecting you."


  "Can I come in?"


  "Of course." Alice''s voice was warm, despite everything.


  They settled in the familiar drawing room—the same room where they''d spent endless
  evenings laughing about Cordelia''s suitors, where Thomas had regaled them with
  tales of typhoons and foreign ports, where Mrs. Whitmore had served her famous rose-water
  bread still warm from the oven.


  The memory of those brighter, gentler days came flooding back—the scent of roses
  and the distant salt of the sea.


  "Alice," Cordelia began, twisting her gloves in her lap, "I know it''s been a long
  time since we''ve really talked, but..." She paused, choosing her words carefully.
  "I saw something recently that deeply disturbed me. As your friend—and I hope you
  know I never stopped being your friend—I must express my concern."


  Alice tilted her head, waiting.


  "I saw you with Dr. Thaddeus the other day. In your garden. Walking together, very...
  close." Cordelia met her friend''s eyes. "Alice, I don''t know what I saw exactly,
  but—"


  A smile crossed Alice''s face—soft, private, the kind of smile that spoke of deep
  happiness. "Thaddeus and I are friends," Alice said quietly. "More than friends.
  He makes me feel... seen. Understood. I think I''m falling in love with him."


  The words sounded strange on her lips, as if she were testing their weight.


  Cordelia''s concern deepened.


  "Alice," she said gently, "are you certain his intentions are... honorable?"


  The hurt that flashed across Alice''s face made Cordelia''s heart ache.


  "Of course they are!" Alice''s voice sharpened. "What else would they be? Have you
  heard how people speak of him? He''s one of the most respected physicians in Long
  Beach. He''s Sebastian''s brother—and frankly, the one with the better reputation."


  The barb struck home. Cordelia felt her cheeks flush.


  "Sebastian loves me," she said, hearing the defensiveness in her own voice. "We''re
  engaged! But Alice, you must consider—does Dr. Thaddeus plan to marry you? To propose
  to a—" She stopped, but it was too late. The words hung in the air.


  "To what, Cordelia?" Alice''s voice was cold now. "A penniless girl? A broken girl
  whose family lost their fortune? Whose brother died at sea? The hysterical girl
  everyone whispers about?"


  "Alice, no, I didn''t mean—"


  "I think you did." Alice stood, her composure intact but her eyes bright with hurt.
  "I love you as a friend, Cordelia. But I think you should leave now. My affairs
  are my own."


  The silence between them was thunderous.


  Cordelia rose slowly, gathering her things. "Alice, please. I''m only worried about—"


  "Goodbye, Cordelia."'
