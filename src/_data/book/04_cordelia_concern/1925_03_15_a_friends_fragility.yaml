location: Cordelia's Diary
content: '<i>I saw Alice today. My dearest friend—or she used to be. We''ve barely
  spoken in months. I told myself it was easier that way, that the distance protected
  us both.


  But today I wanted to share the news: Sebastian and I are engaged!


  When I told her, she smiled and embraced me, said all the right things. But there
  was something hollow in it. Alice looked different—fragile, almost transparent if
  one could describe a person in such a way. Like she''s fading, becoming less solid
  with each passing day.


  I should have been there for her when the news about Thomas arrived. I should have
  run to her side, held her while she grieved. But I couldn''t. I wasn''t even there
  for myself then. I was drowning, and I let her drown alone.


  I''m so sorry, Alice. So terribly sorry.


  But things will be different now. I''m stronger now. I have Sebastian now.


  From now on, I''ll be there for you, Alice. I promise. Whatever you need, whatever
  you''re going through—I won''t abandon you again.


  You''re my dearest friend. And I''ve failed you long enough.</i>'
