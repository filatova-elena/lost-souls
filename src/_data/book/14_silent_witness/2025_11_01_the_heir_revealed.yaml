title: The Heir Revealed
location: Montrose Mansion Grounds
content: 'Slowly, the members of the group gathered in the clearing near the rose
  bush planters at the Montrose mansion. Evening had turned to night, and fog was
  settling among the old sycamore trees, their branches creating skeletal shadows
  in the dim light.


  The Art Collector and the Explorer sat perched on top of an old wooden crate that
  seemed to have appeared in the middle of the garden.


  "Was that always here?" the Heiress thought, frowning. "I don''t remember seeing
  a crate in the middle of the garden before."


  Grandmother stood at the center of the clearing, waiting patiently for everyone
  to gather. When the murmured conversations finally died down, she began.


  "Before we proceed with the matter of the murders," she said, her voice carrying
  clearly through the misty air, "there is one matter that must be settled once and
  for all. The matter of the true heir to the Montrose Estate."


  She turned to the Fiduciary. "Can I ask you to fetch the document located in the
  drawer of the desk in the library?"


  The Fiduciary disappeared into the house. When they returned moments later, they
  were holding a folder of yellowed legal documents.


  The townspeople and investigators began whispering among themselves.


  "Quiet, please," Grandmother said firmly. The whispers ceased.


  The Fiduciary opened their folder and read aloud: "According to the trust records,
  the primary beneficiary of the Montrose Estate was Cordelia Rose Montrose until
  her death on September 24, 1925."


  "And who was the estate supposed to pass to upon Cordelia''s death?" Grandmother
  asked.


  "Eleanor Sullivan," the Fiduciary read. "Illegitimate child of Cordelia Montrose.
  However—" they looked up, adjusting their glasses, "—the adoption by the Sullivan
  family was never properly finalized. It appears the Montroses were so concerned
  with maintaining their reputation and keeping the adoption quiet that they failed
  to complete the legal paperwork correctly."


  "And in your investigation today," Grandmother continued, "who did you discover
  is the heir of Eleanor Sullivan?"


  "That''s you," the Influencer said, phone recording, pointing directly at the Baker.


  The Baker stood frozen, flour still dusted on his shirt from the morning''s baking.


  "That''s correct," Grandmother confirmed. "The Baker is the true heir to the Montrose
  Estate. The rose bread recipe—Cordelia''s favorite—was the legacy she left for her
  only child. A memory of warmth and roses woven through generations, passed from
  Cordelia to Eleanor to you. It can all be verified, of course." She glanced at the
  Fiduciary.


  The Fiduciary nodded solemnly. "The documentation is clear. The Baker is unquestionably
  the rightful heir to the Montrose Estate."


  "Wait, wait!" the Heiress sputtered. "What about me?"


  "Ms. Montrose," the Fiduciary said with barely concealed satisfaction, "upon the
  Baker''s death, the estate would pass according to his will. But as long as he lives,
  it belongs to him."'
