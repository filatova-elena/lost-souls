title: The Truth Revealed
location: Montrose Mansion Grounds
content: '"Speaking of death," one of the townspeople called out, "who actually killed
  everyone?"


  Grandmother smiled—a small, knowing smile. "Of course. It''s time to reveal the
  truth that ended three lives and trapped three souls in this house for a century."


  She walked slowly around the clearing, her hands clasped behind her back.


  "On October 11th, Sebastian Crane died. What a pity that one was! He had such potential,
  so many grand plans." She paused. "And personally, I can admire his potion-brewing
  skills, misguided though they were."


  "Sebastian created his Elixir of Eternal Love with meticulous care—damiana, valerian,
  rose otto, and ginseng root as the binding agent. But someone added an ingredient
  Sebastian never intended: foxglove. Digitalis purpurea. Deadly in concentrated doses,
  and even more insidious when administered slowly over time."


  The group leaned in, listening intently.


  "Dr. Thaddeus Crane was having an affair with Alice Whitmore—his patient, a young
  woman he was supposed to be treating for trauma-induced visions. When Cordelia discovered
  their relationship and threatened to expose it, Thaddeus knew his reputation would
  be destroyed. A respected physician carrying on with a vulnerable patient? The scandal
  would ruin him."


  Grandmother''s voice hardened. "So he decided Cordelia had to die. But it had to
  look natural. He knew his brother Sebastian was planning to give Cordelia the Elixir
  of Eternal Love as a wedding ritual—a romantic gesture, really. Four drops in her
  tea every morning, starting on September 4th, during the conjunction of Jupiter
  and Venus. Celestial timing for eternal love."


  "Thaddeus poisoned the elixir with concentrated foxglove. Not enough to kill quickly—that
  would raise suspicions. Just enough to slowly destroy her over weeks. It would look
  like grief, like melancholia, like a broken heart. The perfect crime for a physician
  who understood exactly how much poison to use."


  The Mortician nodded approvingly. "Chronic digitalis poisoning. Brilliant, in a
  horrifying way."


  "But Thaddeus made one critical miscalculation," Grandmother continued. "He didn''t
  anticipate that Sebastian, being as meticulous as he was about his formula, would
  test his own creation."


  "When Cordelia started getting sick—losing weight, experiencing visual disturbances,
  growing weaker by the day—Sebastian became suspicious. Not of his brother, never
  that. But of his own formula. Had he made a mistake? Had one of his ingredients
  been contaminated?"


  "So Sebastian did what anyone as arrogant as himself would do: he drank a concentrated
  dose of the elixir himself to test it."


  Professor Hartley shook his head. "That would have been a massive dose of foxglove.
  Far more than the gradual amount Cordelia was receiving."


  "Exactly," Grandmother said. "Sebastian died within days. Acute cardiac glycoside
  poisoning. His organs simply failed."


  "When Thaddeus realized what had happened—that Sebastian had poisoned himself accidentally—he
  was devastated. He frantically tried to find an antidote, implementing every treatment
  protocol he knew. But it was too late. And in his grief and panic, he did something
  foolish."


  She paused for dramatic effect. "He confessed everything to Alice Whitmore. The
  woman he loved. He told her he''d poisoned the elixir, that he''d only meant to
  kill Cordelia, that Sebastian''s death was a terrible accident."


  "And Alice," Margo Laveau said softly, "didn''t react the way he expected."


  "No," Grandmother agreed. "That woman had far more backbone than anyone had given
  her credit for. Cordelia thought she needed protecting. Thaddeus thought she would
  be passive and understanding, that she''d help him cover up his crime out of love."


  "But Alice had a gift of seeing the truth and she urged Thaddeus to confess publicly.
  Told him that if he acted immediately, Cordelia might still be saved. That he could
  get her proper treatment, remove the poison from her system before it was too late."


  The clearing was completely silent except for the whisper of wind through the sycamore
  trees.


  "And that''s when Thaddeus killed her," Grandmother said quietly. "The woman he
  claimed to love. He struck her from behind with a silver candlestick—" she gestured
  to the evidence bag the Mortician held "—crushing her skull. Then he staged it to
  look like she''d fallen down the stairs."


  "Sebastian died that same day—October 11th, 1925. Just hours after Alice. 9 days
  later, Cordelia followed, her organs finally giving out after weeks of slow poisoning."


  "Three deaths in less than a month. And Dr. Thaddeus Crane paid Silas Blackwell
  five hundred dollars—more than most morticians made in three months—to falsify the
  death certificates and bury the truth."


  Grandmother stopped walking and faced the assembled group.


  "Now you understand why three spirits have been trapped here for a century."


  "Sebastian''s spirit is tormented because he died believing he had killed Cordelia.
  He cursed himself for failing her, for failing his own craft. He''s been searching
  for his vessel, trying to understand what went wrong, unable to rest while believing
  he''s a murderer."


  "Cordelia''s spirit is restless because she never got to hold her only daughter.
  Never got to tell Eleanor she loved her. Never got to be a mother. She was robbed
  of that—first by her own family who took the baby away, and then by Thaddeus, who
  took her life before she could ever make it right."


  Grandmother''s expression softened slightly as she looked toward the house, as if
  seeing something the others couldn''t.


  "And Alice," she said gently. "Alice is here, but not for herself. She''s not trapped
  by her own unfinished business. Her spirit is lonely, yes—but not because she lost
  her friend, as people assume. No, Alice''s loneliness is simply the path of those
  who have work to do. She stayed to bear witness. To wait for someone who could finally
  see the truth and speak it aloud."


  "Alice can find her own way now," Grandmother said. "She always could."


  The Baker stepped forward, his voice shaking. "How come if you had known all of
  that, you didn''t just say anything?"


  Grandmother smiled cryptically, her expression enigmatic in the November darkness.
  And then, like the mist rolling through the gardens, she began to fade into the
  November air, becoming one with the fog, her form dissolving until nothing remained
  but the memory of her presence and the echo of her knowing smile.'
