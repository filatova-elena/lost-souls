content: '<i>I''ve been feeling strange the past few days. A heaviness in my chest.
  My heart feels... wrong. Fluttering. Irregular. Sometimes it races, sometimes it
  seems to slow to almost nothing.


  I told myself it was just excitement about the wedding. Nerves. But the feeling
  persists.


  When I mentioned it to Sebastian, he looked worried. He said the elixir should make
  me feel strong, not weak. He asked if I wanted to stop drinking it.


  I said no. Of course not. The problem is not the elixir. The problem is the weight
  of everything else. The weight of my past. The weight of decisions made long ago
  that I cannot unmake.


  The elixir is the only thing that feels true anymore.</i>'
