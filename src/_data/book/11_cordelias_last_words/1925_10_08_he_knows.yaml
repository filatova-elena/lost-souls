content: '<i>Sebastian came to see me this afternoon, pale as death. Trembling. He
  said he tested the elixir on himself. That something is wrong with it. That we are
  both becoming ill.


  But how is that possible? The elixir was supposed to be perfect. He worked on it
  for years. Every ingredient was supposed to be harmless.


  He looked at me with such guilt in his eyes. As if he believed he had poisoned me.


  I told him it wasn''t his fault. That whatever this is, we will face it together.
  But even as I said it, I felt the lie in my words. Something is wrong. Something
  is very wrong.</i>'
