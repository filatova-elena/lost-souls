location: Montrose Mansion, Grand Hall
chapter: Cordelia's Last Words
content: 'A few moments later, Margo Laveau found the Heiress in the grand hall by
  the fireplace. Despite the warmth, she was shivering.


  "Psychic encounters can be traumatising, but don''t worry, she will not hurt you.
  I''ve spoken to her. I think I''m starting to piece together why she might be stuck
  in this realm."


  "Oh, yes? Why? I want her gone!"


  "She showed me everything. She''s been waiting a long time to tell her story.


  She was beautiful—not in the way society paintings show beauty, but in the way of
  someone who felt everything deeply. She loved a man named Thomas first, wildly,
  recklessly. But he was lost at sea, and her family... They took her daughter. Her
  baby. They gave the child to the Sullivan family and told Cordelia to forget.


  But she never forgot.


  She tried to build a new life. She met Sebastian Crane—a man she fell in love with
  for the way he saw the world, poetic too, in a way, but his poetry was of a different
  kind. He was making the perfect elixir to bind two souls together. She thought she
  was finally coming home.


  But the elixir was poisoned. That''s what she believed. I felt her getting sicker
  and sicker. In the end it killed them both. Not intentionally, I don''t think it
  was intentional. What she wants you to know—what she''s been screaming into the
  void for a hundred years—is that she didn''t abandon her daughter. She was forced
  to. And even as she was dying, even as her body was failing, all she could think
  about was Eleanor. What she needs to move on is for justice for her daughter to
  be restored."


  The Heiress pondered for a long time. Justice restored? Even if her daughter was
  still alive, she would be 100 years old now, how could justice be restored?


  She looked down at the diary in her hands. Maybe the answers are in it somewhere.


  Leafing through pages of romantic poetry about Thomas, the meeting with Sebastian
  Crane, their courtship through the summer of 1925...


  "There should definitely be clues in here," she whispered.


  She found the later entries and began to read.'
