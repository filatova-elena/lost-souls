location: Cordelia's Diary
chapter: Cordelia's Last Words
content: '<i>I learned today that Alice is dead too. They said she fell. An accident.


  Alice. My oldest friend. The one I pushed away because I couldn''t bear her presence.


  I should have been there for her. I should have continued to protect her. Instead,
  I abandoned her when she needed me most.


  And now Thaddeus''s affair with her is public knowledge. The scandal is all anyone
  speaks of.


  I threatened to expose him. But I didn''t do it. I was too weak, too ill. And now
  Alice is dead and I will never get the chance to ask her forgiveness.</i>'
