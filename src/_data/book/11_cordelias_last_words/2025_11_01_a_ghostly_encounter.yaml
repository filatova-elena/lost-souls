title: A Ghostly Encounter
location: Montrose Mansion, Cordelia's Old Room
content: 'The Heiress pushed open the door to what had been Cordelia Montrose''s bedroom.
  A century of dust motes danced in the afternoon light.


  "It should be here somewhere," she muttered. "This was her room—I know that from
  family stories." She looked around at the ghostly furniture, still arranged as it
  had been in 1925. "Where would I hide it if I were her?"


  Her eyes landed on an ornate writing desk by the window.


  "Ah. Of course."


  She crossed the room and tried the drawers. The first two were empty. The third
  was locked. The Heiress smiled and pulled a hairpin from her hair, working the simple
  lock until it clicked open.


  Inside lay a small diary with a silver clasp, its leather cover worn but intact.

  The Heiress opened it with eager fingers, looking around to make sure nobody was
  watching, as she felt a chill.


  "Ahhhh!" she let out a scream as she saw a glowy vision in front of her, standing
  by the bed, next to the desk.


  "Shoo! Go away!!!"


  The vision stood motionless, dark hair wavy, eyes sad.


  "Step aside, please, Ms. Montrose," said Margo Laveau as she approached the vision.


  "Cordelia? Is that you? Is there something you wish to say?" The vision wasn''t
  moving.


  "Miss Montrose, please, leave now."


  The Heiress scurried out of the bedroom clutching the diary to her chest.'
