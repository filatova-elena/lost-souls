title: A Dangerous Confrontation
location: Cordelia's Diary
content: '<i>I saw Alice today. We haven''t really spoken since our argument in March,
  but I had to see her.


  She seemed so lost. Tired. Transparent, almost. And the rumors about Dr. Thaddeus
  and her are everywhere now. People are starting to talk openly. Oh, Alice! Why won''t
  you listen to me?


  I couldn''t stay silent any longer. Not with Alice at risk. So I went to him. To
  Thaddeus. I confronted him in his office and told him to end it immediately, or
  I would expose his affair to the entire medical board, to all of Long Beach society.
  I told him I would destroy his reputation if he didn''t leave her alone.


  He just smiled at me. That cold, calculating smile. And said: "How very protective
  of you, Cordelia. How very noble."


  I''ve never liked him. There''s something wrong about him. Something is missing.</i>'
