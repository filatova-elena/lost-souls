title: The Missing Pages
location: Montrose Mansion, Cordelia's Old Room
content: 'The Heiress raised her head from the diary, her mind racing.


  She flipped through the remaining pages and her breath caught.


  Several pages had been torn out—jagged edges where entries should have been.


  "The missing pages," she breathed. "They must hold the key about the baby. Who tore
  them out? And where are they now?"


  The Heiress clutched the diary and stood, her pulse racing.


  Somewhere in this mansion, those missing pages were hidden. And they might reveal
  the truth about what really happened in October of 1925.'
