title: Sebastian's Understanding
location: Montrose Mansion, Abandoned Laboratory
content: 'The Professor and Dr. Sinclair had been working through Sebastian Crane''s
  scattered notes for hours when Dr. Sinclair called out from the corner of the laboratory.


  "Professor, look at this. Sebastian''s notes again."


  <strong><i><u>October 6, 1925 - Sebastian''s Notebook - Understanding</u></i></strong>


  <strong><i>I am dying. And I deserve to be.


  I spent years working on a formula I knew nothing about. Thought I could capture
  LOVE in liquid form. I, a man who once mixed the wrong ratio of potassium bromide
  and nearly went blind, could be trusted with Cordelia''s wellbeing.


  I did not verify storage conditions. Did not account for temperature fluctuations.
  I considered this only AFTER my fiancée began showing symptoms.


  I tested on myself—me, the least qualified person to test anything. Should have
  consulted more with Hartley. Should have been more careful.


  And now Cordelia is dying because I was careless. Because I was arrogant.


  I gave her poison thinking it was poetry.</i></strong>


  "He tested it on himself," the Professor said quietly, understanding the implications.
  "Because he loved her and wanted to make sure it was safe."


  "And it wasn''t," Dr. Sinclair replied.


  "Look here, there is a note from Dr. Thaddeus, Sebastian''s brother."


  <strong><i><u>October 7, 1925 - Thaddeus''s Antidote Research Notes</u></i></strong>


  <strong><i>Sebastian has ingested foxglove derivative. Dosage unknown but acute
  symptoms present. The compound can be managed with proper intervention. Cardiac
  glycosides respond to electrolyte management and cardiac support.


  First approach: Gastric lavage immediately to remove remaining toxin from the digestive
  tract. High-dose potassium supplementation. Strict bed rest with cardiac monitoring.


  Second approach: Diuretics to increase urine output and flush toxins from the system.


  This is manageable. I have handled toxin cases before. I am managing it.</i></strong>'
