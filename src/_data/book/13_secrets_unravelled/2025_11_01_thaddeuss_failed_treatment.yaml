title: Thaddeus's Failed Treatment
location: Montrose Mansion, Abandoned Laboratory
chapter: Secrets Unravelled
content: 'Dr. Sinclair looked up at Professor Hartley, his expression grave. "Dr.
  Thaddeus knew about the foxglove. He diagnosed it immediately—look at his notes.
  He knew Sebastian had ingested it and was actively trying to treat him."


  Professor Hartley adjusted his glasses, reading the medical notes more carefully:
  "These are standard 1920s protocols for cardiac glycoside poisoning. Textbook first
  response—gastric lavage, activated charcoal, electrolyte management." He tapped
  the page. "But this confidence here is concerning. Look at his prognosis: ''Good
  if electrolytes are maintained.'' He''s drastically underestimating the severity.
  Most cases of foxglove poisoning this acute don''t respond to standard electrolyte
  management alone."


  "Here are more notes. Dr. Thaddeus again," the Mortician chimed in with an unsettling
  gleam in her eyes.

  <strong><i>Dear Professor Hartley,


  I write regarding a confidential medical matter. A patient has been exposed to concentrated
  foxglove derivative. I am formulating a counter-treatment and require your expertise
  on botanical remedies.


  Specifically: Are there known plants or compounds known to counteract cardiac distress
  from digitalis poisoning? Any botanical knowledge that might provide cardiac support
  would be invaluable.</i></strong>

  <strong><i>[Handwriting deteriorating]


  Hawthorn strengthens heart tissue. Willow bark reduces inflammation. Combined with
  additional potassium and strychnine for cardiac stimulation.


  Dosed patient this morning. Monitoring continuously.


  [Hours later, same page]: NOTHING. No improvement. The heart continues to fail.
  Why doesn''t the body respond to treatment?


  Unless the concentration of toxin is so extreme that my standard protocols cannot
  compete with it.


  Unless I am fundamentally misunderstanding something.</i></strong>

  <strong><i>[Barely legible]


  Sebastian''s heart stopped this morning at 3 AM. I performed manual resuscitation.
  His heart resumed after five minutes. By some miracle.


  I have tried everything. Gastric lavage. Potassium supplementation. Strychnine.
  Nitroglycerin. Willow bark. Hawthorn. Diuretics. Venesection. Every treatment known
  to modern medicine.


  None of it works.


  I am a physician. I am supposed to SAVE LIVES. And I am watching my brother die,
  and I KNOW WHY but I cannot admit WHY and I cannot fix WHAT I HAVE DONE.


  Cordelia is also sick. She is deteriorating rapidly.</i></strong>'
