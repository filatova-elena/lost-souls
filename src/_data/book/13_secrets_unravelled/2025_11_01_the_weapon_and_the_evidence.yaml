title: The Weapon and the Evidence
location: Montrose Mansion, Garden Shed
content: 'The Mortician had spent decades learning to read what bodies revealed. So
  when she found herself drawn to the old garden shed—following instinct honed by
  years of careful observation—she moved with methodical precision.


  It took her twenty minutes to notice the large shipment box tucked behind garden
  tools and rotted burlap. Harbor Trading Company. Dated October 1925.


  Inside, wrapped carefully in burlap that had somehow survived the decades, was a
  silver candelabra. Heavy. Ornate. The kind of piece that would have graced the dining
  room of a grand house.


  The Mortician''s pulse quickened as she examined the base.


  Microscopic specks. Dark. Old. Dried so completely that only someone trained to
  look for such things would notice them.


  She pulled out the magnifying glass—a tool of her trade—and studied the pattern.


  The angle told a story. The distribution spoke of a single, violent blow delivered
  from behind. Not multiple impacts. Not a fall. One strike, delivered with force
  and intention.


  Beneath the box, a leather satchel. Inside, papers.


  Silas Blackwell''s original autopsy notes. The ones that contradicted the official
  death certificate.


  <strong><i><u>Alice Whitmore - Original Assessment</u></i></strong>


  <strong><i>Skull fracture, depressed, occipital region. Inconsistent with accidental
  fall from stairs. Trauma angle suggests horizontal strike from behind with heavy
  object. No defensive wounds. No bruising consistent with tumbling impact. Recommend
  further investigation.</i></strong>


  <strong><i><u>Sebastian Crane - Original Assessment</u></i></strong>


  <strong><i>Systemic poisoning. Severe hepatic damage. Cardiac tissue deterioration.
  Gastric contents show evidence of prolonged toxic exposure. Death likely from acute
  organ failure secondary to poison.</i></strong>


  <strong><i><u>Cordelia Montrose - Original Assessment</u></i></strong>


  <strong><i>Chronic poisoning. Evidence of deliberate, sustained administration over
  extended period. Gastric lining shows repeated exposure to toxic substance. Patterns
  consistent with medical knowledge and access to pharmacological compounds. Cause
  of death: organ failure secondary to chronic poisoning.</i></strong>


  The Mortician carefully lifted something else from Silas''s hidden documents—a small
  card on expensive cream-colored paper, and beside it, a yellowed bank deposit slip.


  At that moment, the Influencer appeared in the laboratory doorway, phone in hand
  as always, but for once not filming. His expression was serious.


  "What have you found here?" he asked, looking at the evidence spread across the
  workbench.


  The Mortician pointed to the heavy silver candlestick sitting on the corner of the
  table. "This. Found it inside an old shipment box from Harbor Imports. It has microscopic
  traces of blood and hair still embedded in the base. This must be the murder weapon.
  What killed Alice Whitmore. And someone paid Silas Blackwell five hundred dollars
  to lie on the death certificates, to call Alice''s death an accident, Sebastian''s
  death accidental poisoning, and Cordelia''s death heart failure."


  The Influencer stepped closer, looking at the bribe note. His eyes widened.


  "''For your discretion,''" he read aloud. Then he looked up sharply. "Wait. I think
  I know who wrote this." He pulled out his phone, scrolling quickly through photos
  he''d taken earlier. "Look at the handwriting here—" he showed them a photo of Dr.
  Thaddeus Crane''s diary entries. "And here—" he held the bribe note next to the
  screen.


  The handwriting was identical. The same elegant, precise script. The same distinctive
  way of forming capital F''s and D''s.'
