  His heart simply... stopped. I was present when it happened. His breathing had become
  labored. His vision was nearly gone. And then his heart, damaged beyond capacity
  to continue, simply ceased its function.


  I stood there for a long moment, watching him. He is gone, the fool that he was.


  And Alice. She is gone - it''s all my fault! I keep thinking about her, her peaceful
  expression in her death. I wonder if she has forgiven me, I wonder if she understood.
  I was so scared, I could not let her expose me. She was innocent, you understand.
  Merely... unfortunate. A casualty of circumstances beyond her control. When her
  breathing stopped, I felt something crack inside me.</i></strong>'
