title: Alice's Appearance
location: Montrose Mansion Gardens
chapter: Secrets Unravelled
content: 'Margo Laveau made her way back toward the main house, her mind heavy with
  the weight of three restless spirits.


  Three souls, trapped for a century. All waiting. All calling to her.


  She thought of her great-grandmother, Celestine Laveau—the legendary spiritualist
  whose name still commanded respect in some circles. Could Margo live up to that
  legacy?


  She thought about the three souls, trapped for a century. All waiting. All calling
  to her. Her thoughts settled on Alice Whitmore.


  Margo had read Celestine''s journals before coming here. There had been an entry
  dated May 1924: "Met with the Whitmore family today. Their daughter Alice has the
  gift—genuine precognitive ability, not the hysteria that fool Morrison diagnosed.
  I''ve offered to train her personally. Such talent is rare. She could become extraordinary."


  And then, just months later, Alice was dead. Skull crushed at the bottom of a staircase.


  She was lost in thoughts as a familiar cold wind swept across the grounds, raising
  goosebumps on Margo''s arms. The temperature dropped ten degrees in an instant.


  She stopped walking.


  The air shimmered in front of her, and she was face to face with Alice Whitmore.


  Except her vision was different from others. Alice appeared almost solid—a young
  woman in a pale dress from the 1920s, her features delicate and clear, her eyes
  bright with intelligence. She looked aware. Conscious in a way ghosts rarely were.
  As if death hadn''t quite managed to claim all of her.


  "Ms. Laveau," Alice said, her voice surprisingly strong. "Thank you for coming.
  I''m so glad you''re here today."


  Margo''s breath caught. She didn''t have to close her eyes, didn''t have to enter
  a trance or carefully attune her senses. Alice was simply there, speaking as clearly
  as any living person.


  A sad smile crossed Alice''s face. "I can see through the veil now from both sides.
  It''s clearer than it ever was when I was alive. Though sometimes..." she faltered,
  "sometimes I get confused. Earlier today, I thought I saw Thomas. But that couldn''t
  be, could it? Decades have passed. If Thomas were alive, he''d be an old man by
  now."


  "Alice," Margo said gently, "tell me—what''s keeping you here?"


  "Justice." The word came out fierce, certain. "Only that justice is served. For
  everyone. For myself, for Sebastian, for my dear friend Cordelia. We''ve been waiting
  so long for someone to see the truth. To understand what really happened."


  "Do you remember what happened to you, Alice?" Margo asked, surprised by the clarity
  of their communication. Most ghosts were just sensations—cold spots, emotional impressions,
  fragments of memory. But Alice was here.


  Alice''s expression grew troubled. Her form flickered slightly, as if the emotion
  was destabilizing her manifestation.


  "I remember..." she began, her voice becoming uncertain. "I remember going to see
  Thaddeus. I remember asking him to confess what he had done - I don''t think he
  meant to do it." Her vision flickered, raw with emotions. "Then, all I remember
  is something hitting me, on the back and everything going dark."


  "It''s all so fuzzy now!" Her voice rose with frustration and fear. "I can''t remember
  the moment—the actual moment it happened. It''s like a blank space in my mind. But
  you must uncover the truth!"


  Then suddenly, Alice Whitmore dissolved into nothing, leaving only the scent of
  roses and the echo of desperate words hanging in the cold November air.'
