title: The Hidden Diary Discovery
location: Montrose Mansion, Abandoned Laboratory
content: 'As Dr. Sinclair, Professor Hartley and the Mortician were processing what
  she had found, Grandmother entered the room. Behind her was the Influencer, recording,
  listening.


  "Find Dr. Thaddeus Crane''s diary," Grandmother said. "It''s hidden in this house
  somewhere. The answers are in those pages."


  The Influencer had overheard Grandmother''s instructions and felt his pulse quicken.
  A hidden diary from a physician at the center of a century-old mystery? This was
  exactly the kind of exclusive that would break the internet.


  He moved through the mansion methodically, phone camera documenting everything.
  The main bedrooms held nothing but dust. The study was locked. The library had too
  many hiding places.


  But the dining room—that felt right.


  It took an hour of careful searching before he found it. The window seat had a loose
  cushion, and beneath it, a floorboard that gave slightly to pressure.


  The Influencer''s heart raced as he pried it up, revealing the oilcloth-wrapped
  bundle in the darkness.


  Dr. Thaddeus Crane''s leather journal, aged but preserved, with a brass lock that
  had long since corroded.


  He found a quiet corner of the mansion and began to read, his phone camera documenting
  each page.


  The early entries were clinical. Medical observations. Notes on psychology and the
  nature of the mind. Dismissive references to his patients'' concerns.


  But as the dates progressed to 1924, something shifted.'
