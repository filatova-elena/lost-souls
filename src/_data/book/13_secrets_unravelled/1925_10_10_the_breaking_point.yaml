content: '<strong><i>I cannot continue this deception. I cannot. The weight of it
  is suffocating me. When Sebastian walked into my office today, pale and trembling,
  describing the very symptoms I knew he would describe, I felt something splinter
  inside me. This is what I have done. This.


  I have ruined him. Cordelia too. They will both suffer because of my arrogance,
  my resentment, my pathetic need to escape my brother''s shadow. And for what? For
  Alice? For some imagined transformation of my circumstances? What have I become?
  Alice came to see me this evening. She knew something was wrong—she always knows.
  I could not lie to her. I told her everything. The formula. The foxglove. My intentions.
  My weakness.


  She listened in silence, and then she took my hands and said: "Thaddeus, you must
  confess. You must go to the authorities and tell them what you have done. You must
  save yourself before this destroys you completely."


  But I cannot confess. I cannot. If I do, everything ends. My reputation. My practice.
  My freedom. Perhaps my life itself. I tried to explain this to Alice, and she looked
  at me with such disappointment. Such contempt, even. I told her that I had no choice.
  That circumstances forced my hand. But we both knew I was lying. I am a coward.
  A murderer and a coward. This is what I am. This is what I have always been, beneath
  the veneer of superiority. Alice sees it now. She sees me clearly for the first
  time, and she is disgusted.


  I cannot confess. But I cannot live with this either. I am trapped between two impossible
  truths, and I have no path forward that does not end in destruction.</i></strong>'
