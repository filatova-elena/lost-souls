chapter: Secrets Unravelled
content: <strong><i>Cordelia died this morning. The autopsy will show cardiac failure.
  Natural causes, it will be recorded. A young woman's heart failing after her fiancé's
  sudden death, considering what she suffered, it is not surprising. I sat with her
  through her final hours. She was delirious with pain, confused, asking for Sebastian.
  I gave her morphine. I held her hand with genuine compassion while my other hand
  made careful notes of her declining vital signs.</i></strong>
