content: |
  Alice spotted Cordelia on the street corner near the library and hurried toward her, relief flooding through her chest.

  "Cordelia! Oh, it's so good to see you're back from Rome. I've missed you terribly!" She reached for her friend's hand. "Why haven't you replied to any of my letters?"

  "I'm sorry, Alice." Cordelia's voice was flat, distant. "I've been... unwell."

  "For all those months?"

  The hurt crept into Alice's voice. When the news had arrived in March—Thomas's ship was lost in a storm off the coast of Japan, all hands presumed dead—Alice had written immediately. Then again the next week. And the week after that.

  Every letter had gone unanswered.

  "I thought you cared about him," Alice said quietly, disappointment threading through her words. "About Thomas."

  Cordelia looked away.

  "Alice, please." Her voice broke. "Don't speak of him."

  It was only then that Alice noticed how much Cordelia changed.

  Cordelia had always been slender, now she seemed fragile like the wind could knock her off her feet. But it was her eyes that shocked Alice most—those large brown eyes that had always been so alive with dreams and poetry were hollow.

  "Cordelia..." Alice whispered, an alarm replacing her hurt. "What happened to you?"

  "I have to go." Cordelia was already backing away, her gloved hands trembling as she clutched her handbag. Tears shimmered at the corners of her eyes, threatening to spill over. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

  She turned and walked away quickly, almost fleeing.

  Alice stood frozen on the sidewalk, confusion washing over her.

  Everyone grieves differently, but the look in Cordelia's eyes—that wasn't just grief.
