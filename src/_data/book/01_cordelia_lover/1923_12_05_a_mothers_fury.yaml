  December arrived, and with it, a creeping dread Cordelia could no longer ignore. Her courses hadn't come. Then another month passed. The morning sickness began in earnest—she'd barely make it through breakfast before needing to excuse herself.

  She tried to hide it, but mothers notice everything.

  It happened one morning when Cordelia fled the breakfast table for the third time that week. Her mother followed her upstairs, found her pale and trembling by the basin.

  "How long?" Her mother's voice was ice.

  Cordelia couldn't speak.

  "How. Long."

  "Two months," Cordelia whispered. "Perhaps three."

  The slap came swift and sharp. Then silence—worse than any shouting. Her mother's face had gone white, her hands shaking with barely controlled fury.

  "That sailor," she said finally, the word dripping with venom. "You've ruined us. Ruined everything."
