  Cordelia woke that morning with a dull throb behind her temples—whether from the cigar smoke or the crushing boredom of the previous evening's conversations, she couldn't say. She had to see Alice.

  She walked briskly through downtown Long Beach, her heels clicking against the pavement as she approached the Whitmore house. It was a handsome Victorian, though the paint had begun to peel near the eaves and the front garden had grown a bit wild. Still, it had character.

  Lost in rehearsing her complaints, she nearly collided with someone coming down the front steps.

  "Oh! You must be Cordelia."

  She looked up sharply—and her breath caught.

  The man before her was nothing like the waxwork figures from last night's dinner. His skin was bronze from the sun, his eyes an impossible shade of blue, like the ocean on a clear day. Dark blond hair fell across his forehead, windswept and careless. He wore no tie, his shirt collar open at the throat.

  "Alice has been waiting for you," he continued, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth. "I'm Thomas. Her brother."

  "Yes, I—" Cordelia's voice came out smaller than intended. She cleared her throat. "Alice mentioned you'd be returning this fall."

  "Guilty as charged. Shall we?" He gestured toward the door with an easy grace entirely foreign to the stiff, formal men of her parents' world.

  Inside, Alice appeared in a flurry of excitement. "Oh, you've met! Finally!" She clasped Cordelia's hands, her eyes dancing. "Isn't he just as I described? And Cordelia, you must hear his stories—shipwrecks and storms and ports in the Orient. Each tale is more thrilling than the last!"

  Cordelia embraced her friend, then stole another glance at Thomas. Tall, sun-weathered, with the easy posture of someone accustomed to ship decks rather than drawing rooms. And he had tales.

  They settled in the modest parlor—worn furniture but comfortable, books stacked haphazardly, nothing like the pristine, untouched perfection of her own home.

  "Well," Alice prompted, settling into the sofa with relish, "tell us about last night's torture. How many identical men did your mother parade before you this time?"

  Cordelia laughed despite herself. "I honestly couldn't say. They blend together—same suits, same cigars, same glassy expressions while droning on about stocks and bonds. I've decided they must be manufactured somewhere. A factory that produces Suitable Young Men, all from the same mold."

  Thomas, leaning against the mantelpiece, let out a genuine laugh. "I used to sit through evenings exactly like that," he said, his voice warm but edged with something darker. "Watched my father's face grow grayer at each one, watched him chase those same conversations about markets and margins." He paused, his blue eyes distant for a moment. "Then it all vanished. Just like that. One bad investment, one banking panic, and decades of 'security' gone like smoke."

  He straightened, his expression clearing. "That's why I chose the sea. People say a merchant captain isn't a respectable profession for a gentleman." He shrugged, unbothered. "But there isn't a single morning I wake up regretting it. Not when I have blue skies overhead and salt spray on my face. Not when I'm living instead of slowly fossilizing in some office, worrying about numbers in a ledger."

  Cordelia found she couldn't look away from him.

  "That sounds," she said softly, "absolutely wonderful."
