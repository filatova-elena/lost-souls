  I kept hoping I would wake one morning and discover this was all a terrible dream,
  but it''s been three months now, and there''s no denying it any longer.


  Thomas won''t reach port until spring at the earliest. Even if I wrote to him today,
  the letter wouldn''t arrive for months. He''s out there somewhere on the Pacific,
  completely unaware, while I''m trapped here watching Mother''s face grow colder
  by the hour.

  I''m—" No. I can''t bear to see the shock in her eyes. The disappointment.

  What will he do? What can he do? Send me away? Disown me? Force me to—


  I can''t think about it. I can''t.


  Thomas, where are you?</i>'
