  Cordelia Montrose, a young woman of 24 was sitting by a large bay window of her room in her family's mansion in Long Beach, her long brown hair loosely pinned at the sides falling in waves to her shoulders. Her large brown eyes were alive and dreamy as she was looking at a darkening garden and thinking of her first love, her childhood sweetheart named Oliver…

  She unlocked a small silver clasp of her diary and wrote:

  ***October 15th, 1923***

  ***My heart is like a wounded bird,***

  ***That flutters when I hear your name,***

  ***And every tender, whispered word***

  ***Sets my foolish soul aflame…***

  She pressed her pen to the page, preparing to continue, when her mother's voice rang sharply from downstairs.

  "Cordelia! Cordelia! What are you still doing up there! It's time to go!"

  Cordelia's shoulders sagged. Another dinner party. Her father hosted them every other week for his business associates—endless evenings where she was expected to sit prettily and smile at whichever eligible bachelor her parents had deemed "suitable."

  She closed the diary with a soft click and tucked it into the drawer of her writing desk.

  The men were interchangeable, really. Each one arrived in the same dark suit and pomaded hair, clutching the same cigar. They all had that peculiar glazed look in their eyes—as if someone had wound them up like mechanical toys and set them to drone about profit margins with a deadening enthusiasm until their springs ran down. Even the young ones, barely past thirty, somehow managed to seem ancient, fossilized by their own tedium.

  Her mother called them "excellent prospects." Cordelia thought they could bore a person to death at twenty paces.

  "Cordelia! Now!"
