title: Why Am I Here?
location: Montrose Mansion Main Entrance
content: 'The Baker stood before the Montrose mansion, holding a basket wrapped in
  linen cloth, still uncertain why he had driven here.


  This morning, flour had been on his hands as always. He''d been measuring rose petals
  for the morning batch—a routine performed a thousand times. Rosebuds gathered at
  dawn, dried in glass jars, the precise measurements from the recipe he''d carried
  his whole life.


  That recipe was his only inheritance.


  When someone left him as an infant on the concrete steps of St. Mary Medical Center, the recipe
  had been wedged deep between the quilted padding and the plastic shell of an infant carrier—pressed inside a worn leather journal belonging
  to someone named Eleanor. The journal also contained a faded black-and-white photograph
  of a striking young woman with large brown eyes and long dark hair, standing in
  a garden surrounded by roses.


  No note. No explanation. Just the journal, the photograph, and a recipe for rose
  bread.


  The Baker had been kneading dough this morning when Grandmother''s invitation arrived.
  An investigation at the Montrose mansion. A century-old mystery to be solved. Your
  presence is requested.


  He should have thrown it away. He had orders to fill, customers waiting, the rhythm
  of his daily work calling him.


  But something had pulled at him. A knowing. The same intuition that told him when
  a customer needed honey instead of sugar in their tea, when someone was carrying
  grief too heavy for words, when a loaf needed five more minutes even though the
  timer said it was done. People called it empathy. His old therapist had called it
  hypervigilance—a survival mechanism from an uncertain childhood.


  But the Baker knew what it really was: he sensed things. Saw connections others
  missed. The world spoke to him in whispers and gut feelings he''d learned long ago
  to trust.


  So he wrapped the rose bread in cloth—the same recipe from Eleanor''s journal, the
  one he''d perfected over years—got in his car, and drove to this mansion without
  quite understanding why.'
