location: Eleanor's Diary
content: '<i>Today I stood in the bakery kneading dough, and Mother complimented my
  technique. ''You have a gift for this,'' she said. ''It''s in your blood.''


  And I thought: which blood? The Sullivan blood, from the people who raised me? Or
  the blood of my birth mother?


  Mother taught me bread-making when I could barely reach the counter. This is the
  legacy I''ve been given.


  But the rose bread is different. When I bake the rose bread, I feel connected to
  something. To someone. I taste love in every loaf.


  I wonder if that was intentional. I wonder if my mother knew that someday her daughter
  would bake this bread and understand, somehow, what it meant.


  I think of her every time my hands shape the dough.</i>'
