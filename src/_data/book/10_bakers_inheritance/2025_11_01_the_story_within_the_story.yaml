content: 'The Influencer practically vibrated with energy when he saw the Baker, phone
  already raised, eyes alight with that particular hunger content creators get when
  they spot a story.


  "Oh, you brought food!" he said, and the Baker could see him calculating angles,
  trying to figure out how to frame the basket for maximum appeal. "You''re the baker,
  right? From that place downtown?"


  "Sweet Rose Bakery," the Baker confirmed, offering the basket. "I brought rose bread.
  It''s—"


  "Oh my God, yes! Rose bread!" The Influencer took a piece, his expression shifting
  from performance to genuine appreciation. "This is incredible. You know, there''s
  this whole crazy story about a bakery that burned down in the 1990s? It was supposed
  to be famous for rose bread. The fire was never really explained—some people think
  arson, others think it was insurance fraud, but the family died in it. Parents and
  grandparents, I think? Super tragic."


  The Baker''s hands went still. Rose bread. Bakery fire. He needed to know more.


  "Oh, here," the Influencer said, already scrolling on his phone. "I have a link."

  <strong><i>DEVASTATING BLAZE DESTROYS SULLIVAN BAKERY


  Beloved Long Beach Institution Lost to Suspicious Fire


  SULLIVAN''S BAKERY, a Long Beach institution for over sixty years, burned to the
  ground late last night in a fire that left two dead and raised troubling questions
  about the blaze''s origin. The bodies have been identified as David Sullivan, 38,
  owner of the bakery, and Catherine Sullivan, 36, his wife. Reports state the Sullivans
  had an infant child, though no body has been recovered despite extensive searches
  of the ruins.


  Fire Marshal David Chen stated: "The fire spread with unusual rapidity. The preliminary
  finding is electrical wiring failure."


  Accelerant patterns were noted by responding firefighters, and one neighbor reported
  seeing an unidentified figure fleeing the building in the darkness.


  Sullivan''s Bakery had operated continuously since 1927, founded by Eleanor Sullivan
  and famous for the family''s rose bread recipe passed down through generations.
  The timing is notable: this fire occurs just as new interest in the 1925 Montrose
  mystery has surfaced. The official investigation concludes electrical failure, yet
  questions linger about the accelerant evidence and the Sullivan family connection
  to those historical events.</i></strong>


  The Baker looked up from his phone, his face drained of color.


  Eleanor Sullivan. She''d founded the bakery. The original rose bread bakery.


  It was her diary he''d been carrying his whole life. Her recipe he''d been baking
  every morning. Her photograph he kept tucked in his kitchen—the woman with the large
  brown eyes standing in a garden of roses. Was that her?


  And the baby''s body was never recovered from the fire.


  His thoughts raced, connections forming like bread dough coming together—separate
  ingredients suddenly becoming something whole.


  Who am I?


  And more urgently: Who set that fire?


  He thought he knew the diary''s contents by heart by now—had read Eleanor''s words
  so many times the pages were worn soft as fabric. He''d connected with her longing,
  her not knowing where she came from, who her real mother was. The ache of being
  given away.


  He''d thought he understood those feelings because he shared them.


  But now he needed to read it again. Be sure. See what he might have missed.'
