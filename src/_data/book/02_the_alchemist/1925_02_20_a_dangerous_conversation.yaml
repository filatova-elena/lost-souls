  ![Sebastian and Frankie's argument on the docks](../assets/docks_argument.png)

  Sebastian Crane approached the familiar docks at the port of Long Beach with a sense of dread coiling in his gut. His relationship with Cordelia was evolving into something deeper—something real—and soon he planned on proposing. But he couldn't allow his dirty dealings with Frankie "The Coast" Romano to interfere with those plans.

  Sure, he and Frankie had made a killing providing bootleg booze to the speakeasies up and down the coast, but it was time to end it. He'd made a significant fortune, and his investments were performing well. He no longer needed to get his hands dirty. The pharmacy, the bootleg business—it was time to leave it all behind.

  But Frankie wouldn't like that. Still, Sebastian was certain he'd accept it eventually. They were reasonable men, after all.

  The salt air hung heavy as Sebastian reached the weathered planks of the dock. Frankie was waiting as expected, a dark silhouette against the fading light, cigarette glowing between his fingers. Sebastian glanced around—it was a quiet evening, no one in sight, but you never knew who might be listening in this business.

  "Frankie, we gotta talk. I can't be doing this anymore."

  Frankie's eyes narrowed. "Whaddya mean you can't? We just started rakin' it in!"

  "I know, but these high society types—the Montrose family—they got their noses in everything. They're gonna find out about you and me, and then—"

  "High society?" Frankie took a step closer, his voice rising. "I stuck my NECK out for you! Told the boys you was good for it!"

  "And we made money, didn't we? Real good money. I'll square up whatever you want—"

  "You SWORE this would be the biggest take we ever seen!" Frankie's voice carried across the water now, and a few dock workers turned to look. "Said we'd be set for life! And now that the dough's finally rollin' in, you wanna beat it and play Mr. Respectable?"

  "Keep it down, will ya—"

  "You think you're some kind of big shot now? Too good for the likes of me?" Frankie jabbed a finger into Sebastian's chest. "You gave your WORD, Sebastian!"

  Sebastian held up his hands, trying to placate him. "I'll get you someone else, someone just as good who can—"

  "So that's it?" Frankie was shouting now, his face flushed with rage. "You USE me to get started, and soon as you got what you need, you're gonna blow? That ain't how this game works, pal!"

  "Frankie, please, just listen—"

  "You don't just WALK AWAY from Frankie Romano. Not from this. Not from ME." He stepped closer, his voice dropping to something more dangerous than a shout. "We had a DEAL."

  Frankie shoved Sebastian hard. Sebastian stumbled backward, his heel catching on an uneven plank. He caught himself against a piling, then turned and hurried off the docks, Frankie's furious stare burning into his back.

  As he reached solid ground, Sebastian realized with a sinking feeling that this wasn't over. Not by a long shot.
