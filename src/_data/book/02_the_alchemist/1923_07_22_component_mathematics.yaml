  ***Component Mathematics***

  *Months I have been at this. And I understand nothing!*

  *Wait—no. I understand EVERYTHING. The mathematics are perfect:*

  *Damiana: 3 parts (desire, heat, awakening)*

  *Valerian Root: 2 parts (calm, trust, grounding)*

  *Rose Otto: 1 drop only (Venus—transcendence)*

  *Potassium Bromide: 10 grains (medicine's knowledge)*

  *Calcium Lactate: 5 grains (strength)*

  *Iron Citrate: 3 grains (vitality)*

  *Grain Alcohol: 8 oz base*

  *Flavored with vanilla extract, cherry syrup, honey. Palatable. Even pleasant.*

  *But it's MISSING something. The crucial element. The thing that transforms infatuation into devotion. Desire into permanence.*

  *What binds? What speaks to commitment, to the eternal quality of true love?*

  *I'll find it. I know I will.*

  *And when I do—when I finally meet HER—when the woman worthy of my finest work crosses my path*

  *I will be prepared.*

  *The formula will be perfect.*
