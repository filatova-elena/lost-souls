  and Cordelia meet in the speakeasy">


  It was a warm September evening, the air thick with distant salt of the sea and
  promise. Fallen sycamore leaves scattered across the ground, and the tall Mexican
  Fan Palms lining the street swayed like a conspiracy of gossiping teenagers, their
  fronds whispering secrets against the darkening sky.


  Cordelia had been back in Long Beach for weeks now, but she still couldn''t bring
  herself to slip back into her old self. Her mother and father had resumed their
  routines as though nothing had happened—dinner parties, business calls, polite society.
  She almost wished they''d remained cold and distant.


  She''d had enough of pretending.


  Tonight, she told herself, she would start living the way Thomas had lived—boldly,
  freely, without fear of consequence.


  Her young cousin Mary had told her about the speakeasies. Mary, who presented such
  a perfect image of virtue to society while being the most delightfully mischievous
  creature alive. They''d arranged to meet by the bank building on Pine Avenue after
  dark.


  Cordelia waited until the household had gone to bed, then slipped out of the mansion
  like a thief, her heart pounding with equal parts fear and exhilaration.


  The speakeasies were forbidden. Illegal. Dangerous.


  She felt alive for the first time in months.

  Sebastian Crane stood in the corner of the speakeasy, dark eyes surveying the crowd
  with amusement. The air was thick with jazz music, cigarette smoke, and the sharp
  tang of bootleg gin.


  He''d always been the black sheep of the Crane family. His brother Thaddeus was
  the golden child—the physician, beloved by Long Beach society. Sebastian, on the
  other hand, had spent his childhood setting small fires during chemistry experiments
  and mixing volatile compounds in his father''s shed. His parents had been equal
  parts proud and exasperated.


  Now he was a pharmacist by day, chemist by nature, and opportunist by necessity.
  Prohibition had been a gift to men like him. Through his connection with Frankie
  Romano at the port, Sebastian supplied half the speakeasies in Long Beach with grain
  alcohol—all perfectly legal, of course. Medical supplies. Medicinal tonics. The
  paperwork was impeccable. Among certain circles, he''d earned a reputation: they
  called him The Alchemist, a man who could transmute legality into fortune, who understood
  that the right chemistry could transform anything—prohibition into profit, powder
  into potion, law into opportunity.


  He watched the crowd with detached interest. Respectable people pretending to be
  dangerous, their laughter a touch too loud, their movements a touch too reckless.
  Playing at rebellion.


  Then he heard laughter to his right—bright and unrestrained.


  He turned.


  The woman had large brown eyes that caught the low lamplight, sparkling with mischief.
  High society, certainly—he could tell by the cut of her dress, the way she held
  herself. But there was something untamed about her, something that didn''t quite
  fit the polished surface. When she laughed, she wasn''t pretending.


  Their eyes met across the hazy room.


  She smiled at him—not coy, not calculated. Just smiled, as if she''d found something
  surprising and delightful.


  Sebastian couldn''t look away.'
