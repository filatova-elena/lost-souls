title: The Pocket Watch
location: Sebastian's House on Ocean Boulevard
content: 'Sebastian paced the neat drawing room of his recently purchased house on
  Ocean Boulevard, his thoughts settling pleasantly on his recent engagement to Cordelia
  Montrose.


  The Montroses had been cold and disapproving at first—naturally, a pharmacist wasn''t
  their ideal choice. But once they''d learned more about Sebastian''s standing in
  the community, and more importantly, his not insignificant fortune (of somewhat
  dubious origins, perhaps, but quite substantial nonetheless), they''d stopped asking
  uncomfortable questions. Mr. Montrose had even consulted him recently about strategic
  investments in pharmaceutical companies. How quickly attitudes shifted when money
  entered the equation!


  The postman''s knock interrupted his pleasant reverie. Sebastian retrieved the letter
  from the hall table—his brother''s handwriting on the envelope, neat and precise
  as always.


  Inside was a congratulatory card and something wrapped in velvet. He unfolded the
  letter and read:


  <strong><i>My Dear Brother,


  I present to you this timepiece on the occasion of your engagement to Miss Montrose.
  It marks not merely the hours and minutes of our earthly existence, but something
  far more significant.


  Inside, I have engraved the date of September''s astronomical event you spoke of—the
  conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, a celestial alignment that occurs but once in
  a generation. The timing of your engagement and upcoming wedding is very fortunate
  indeed. The ancients believed such moments carried profound significance, marking
  the intersection of love and fortune.


  I thought it fitting that you should carry with you a record of this sacred timing.
  Let it remind you that some moments in life are written in the stars themselves.


  May your union be as harmonious as the heavens above.


  Your devoted brother, Thaddeus</i></strong>


  Sebastian unwrapped the velvet carefully. Inside was a pocket watch—simple, without
  unnecessary ornamentation, yet elegant in its restraint. Bronze casing, substantial
  weight, the kind of timepiece a serious man would carry. He opened it.

  The date was engraved inside with exquisite precision, surrounded by the symbols
  of the planets arranged around a central sun. The celestial diagram was beautifully
  rendered, almost mystical.


  His brother truly understood him.


  Sebastian closed the watch with a satisfying click and slipped it into his waistcoat
  pocket, feeling its comforting weight against his chest. What a fortunate thing,
  to have a brother like Thaddeus. Since childhood, Thaddeus had always encouraged
  Sebastian''s chemical experiments and pharmaceutical pursuits, even when their parents
  had been skeptical—even alarmed.


  Everything was falling into place exactly as it should.'
