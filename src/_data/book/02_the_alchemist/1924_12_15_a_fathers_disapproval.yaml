  ![Cornelius and Margaret Montrose in disapproval](../assets/montrose_disapproval.png)

  "A pharmacist? Pursuing a Montrose?" - Cornelius Montrose's usually immovable face twisted into a mask of anger.

  "I've made inquiries about the Crane boy," said Margaret Montrose, settling into the chair across from his desk. She held a small sheaf of notes. "Sebastian Crane. He's the younger brother of Dr. Thaddeus Crane—quite well-regarded as a physician. Their father was also a doctor, respected in his time. The family has standing."

  "He's a pharmacist." Cornelius Montrose's face remained immobile, carved from stone. "Hardly a suitable match for a Montrose."

  "You know very well, Cornelius," Margaret said carefully, her thin face angled toward him, "why we cannot afford to be particular."

  His jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. "She is still a Montrose."

  With a look of annoyed patience, Margaret continued:

  "The gossip about her prolonged 'European vacation' has already begun. People are counting months, making calculations. We need to act quickly, or no respectable man will have her at all."

  The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken failure.

  Finally, Cornelius exhaled through his nose—the closest he came to expressing resignation.

  "Very well. Invite him to dinner. Let us see what sort of man he is."

  Margaret rose smoothly. "I'll send the invitation tomorrow."

  She swept from the room, leaving her husband alone seething in his disappointment.
