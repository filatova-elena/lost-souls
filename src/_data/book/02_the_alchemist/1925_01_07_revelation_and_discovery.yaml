  She was in the Montrose garden among the roses, her dress the pale blush of tea
  roses, flowing in the afternoon breeze. She moved through the rosebushes like she
  herself was a rose—inevitable, perfect, meant to be.


  All these years of theoretical work—this MEANS something. This is what it was all
  for.


  I spoke to Dr. Hartley at the university yesterday about the formula. Hartley knows
  his botanical work exceptionally well, though he has the peculiar quality of discussing
  ancient poisons with the same enthusiastic precision he brings to medicinal herbs.
  Frankie occasionally consults him about rare botanicals imported through Harbor
  Imports—if Hartley notices anything unusual about the nature of these consultations,
  he shows no signs of it. Odd fellow. Sometimes he gets that distant look in his
  eyes, as if his mind has wandered to some faraway place. Perhaps, the man simply
  loves his plants, whether they heal or harm.


  He confirmed my base ingredients are sound—the damiana for desire and warmth, the
  valerian for calm and trust, the rose otto for transcendence. But I asked him specifically
  about Panax ginseng, the true Oriental variety.


  Hartley, in his typical thorough manner, explained its three-thousand-year history
  in Chinese medicine. The root is prized not merely as a tonic for vitality, but
  as a symbol of lasting union in traditional wedding preparations. The Chinese believe
  it enhances what they call "qi"—the vital force—but more importantly, it represents
  permanence, endurance, and the binding of souls.


  That''s when I understood.


  The ginseng root isn''t just another botanical—it''s the binding agent I''ve been
  searching for. Not to create passion, which is fleeting, but to suggest commitment
  at the deepest level. To transform attraction into devotion.


  Just a small amount. Five grains of the aged Korean root, dissolved with the other
  botanicals. Enough to whisper "forever" into the formula.


  The missing piece has been found.</i>'
