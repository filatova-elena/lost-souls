title: The Dress and Its Secrets
location: Monroe Tailor and Alterations, Long Beach
content: 'When the Dressmaker heard about the investigation at the Montrose mansion,
  their hands began to tremble.


  That dress... the one that held ghosts in its folds.


  The Dressmaker walked to the back of their shop, past the modern sewing machines
  and bolts of contemporary fabric, to the old mahogany armoire that had belonged
  to their great-grandfather, Elias Monroe.


  They opened the carved wooden doors with reverent hands.


  And there it was.


  Even after a hundred years, even wrapped in yellowed muslin and tissue paper, it
  was breathtaking. A wedding dress, never worn. Ivory silk that still held its lustrous
  sheen. Delicate Chantilly lace at the collar and sleeves. Thirty-two pearl buttons
  down the back, each one sewn by hand with thread so fine it was barely visible.


  Elias Monroe had been a master of his craft—sought after by the wealthiest families
  in 1920s Long Beach, known for his artistry and uncompromising precision. This dress
  had been his masterpiece.


  But there was something else tucked inside the folds of muslin.


  A small cedar box, no bigger than a book.


  The Dressmaker lifted it carefully and opened the lid. Inside was a photograph—sepia-toned,
  edges worn soft with age. A young woman stood in a garden surrounded by roses, her
  large brown eyes full of dreams and poetry. She wore a dress the pale blush of tea
  roses, and her long hair was pinned loosely at the sides.


  On the back, in Elias''s careful copperplate handwriting: "My muse. C.M."


  Beneath the photograph were folded papers—poems, written in the same precise hand.


  The Dressmaker picked up the first one, dated and creased with age:


  <strong><i><u>"For Cordelia" (Unsent) - August 20, 1925</u></i></strong>


  <strong><i>She turns to roses in the garden light,


  Not knowing I have fallen into night.


  Each stitch I sew, each pin I place with care—


  My heart caught in the dress she''ll never wear.</i></strong>


  The Dressmaker''s throat tightened. They picked up the second poem. The handwriting
  was shakier here, less controlled, as if written in distress:


  <strong><i><u>"Watching Her Fade" (Unsent) - October 8, 1925</u></i></strong>


  <strong><i>She wears her beauty now like sorrow''s crown,


  I fit the silk and dare not let her down.


  She''s lost the light she carried like a flame—


  Some poison''s in her now. Who is to blame?</i></strong>


  The Dressmaker stared at the date. October 8, 1925. Just 9 days before Cordelia
  Montrose died—supposedly of heart failure, supposedly from grief over her husband''s
  sudden death.


  But that line...


  "Some poison''s in her now. Who is to blame?"


  Elias had known something. And he''d written it down in poetry because he had no
  other way to speak the truth.


  The Dressmaker carefully refolded the poems and placed them back in the box with
  the photograph. Then they lifted the wedding dress from the armoire—still perfect,
  still waiting, still holding the ghost of a woman who''d never gotten to wear it.


  This dress had a story to tell.


  And the Dressmaker was going to make sure someone finally listened.


  I must get to the Montrose mansion, they thought, already reaching for their coat.'
