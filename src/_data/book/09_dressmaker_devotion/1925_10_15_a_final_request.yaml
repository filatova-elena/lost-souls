  Elias Monroe stood at the entrance of the Montrose mansion, a feeling of dread settling over him like a shroud. The house loomed above—grand, imposing, and somehow wrong.

  Cordelia had sent for him. The note had been brief, urgent: ***Please come. I need to see you. There isn't much time.***

  A maid led him upstairs to Cordelia's bedroom. When he entered, his breath caught in his throat.

  She sat propped against pillows, her face pale as the ivory silk of her unworn wedding dress. The vibrant woman he'd measured just weeks ago had become a ghost—white as a sheet, hollowed out.

  "Elias," she said, her voice thin but warm. "Thank you for coming."

  "Cordelia." He crossed the room quickly, taking the chair beside her bed. "Your note—you said you were unwell…"

  She smiled sadly. "I think I'm dying, Elias."

  "Don't speak like that." The words came out sharper than he intended. "What does the doctor say? Surely there's treatment—"

  "Oh, Thaddeus?" A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "He says it's grief. That I'm dying of a broken heart over Sebastian's death." She looked at him directly, her large brown eyes still beautiful despite the shadow of death in them. "But I know better. Something is eating away at my insides. I can feel it—like a slow fire consuming me from within."

  Elias felt ice in his veins. "Then you need another doctor. Someone who will actually help—"

  "It's too late for that." Her hand reached out, thin and trembling, and grasped his. "Please, Elias. Let's not speak of it now. I have something to ask you. Will you do something for me?"

  "Anything." The word came without hesitation.

  Cordelia took a shaking breath. "When I was younger, I was foolish and..." Her voice broke. Tears spilled down her pale cheeks. "And it doesn't matter now what happened. But Elias, I have a daughter. Her name is Eleanor."

  Elias went very still. He remembered 1924—Cordelia's sudden "vacation" to Europe, nine months gone, the strange vagueness about her travels.

  "All I can think about these last few days is her," Cordelia continued, her voice urgent now, desperate. "My little girl. I never got to hold her. Never got to tell her I loved her. They took her away immediately—said it was for the best, that she'd have a proper family, a proper life."

  "Cordelia..."

  "Please." She pressed a folded paper into his hand. "I want to leave something for her. Just a small thing—something that shows I thought of her, that I loved her even though I could never be her mother."

  Elias unfolded the paper carefully. It was a recipe, written in Cordelia's careful hand:

  ***Rose Bread - My favorite***

  "Mail this to her, Elias. To Eleanor. Wherever she is, whatever family has her."

  Elias clutched the recipe, his own eyes burning. "I promise. I'll find her. I'll make sure she knows."

  "Thank you." Cordelia closed her eyes, exhausted from the effort of speaking. "You've always been such a good friend to me, Elias…"

  "Cordelia?"

  She didn't answer.

  Elias sat with her as the afternoon light faded, holding her hand, the recipe pressed against his heart.

  Two days later, she was gone.
