title: Sebastian's Jealousy
location: Montrose Mansion, The Abandoned Laboratory
content: 'The Professor and Dr. Sinclair had been methodically searching the laboratory
  for hours, documenting every jar, every scrap of paper, every clue to what Sebastian
  Crane had been creating in this dusty shed.


  The Professor was examining botanical samples when Dr. Sinclair called out from
  the main workbench.


  "Found something. More of Sebastian''s notes."


  They were scattered across the workbench—loose pages, some water-stained, others
  perfectly preserved. Dr. Sinclair picked up one that was dated late August and began
  to read aloud:


  <strong><i><u>August 24, 1925 - Sebastian''s Notebook</u></i></strong>


  <strong><i>Elias Monroe has been spending considerable time with Cordelia on the
  dress alterations. Fittings, measurements, consultations—it all seems excessive
  for a wedding dress, even one as elaborate as ours will be.


  I know he is a craftsman, meticulous about his work. His reputation is built on
  perfection. But something in his demeanor troubles me. The way he looks at her when
  he thinks no one is watching. The way he finds excuses to extend their appointments.


  Cordelia insists the dress is not yet perfect, that he is merely being thorough.
  She sees no cause for concern.


  And yet.


  But I have faith in my elixir. I feel us becoming more bound with each passing day.
  The ritual draws us closer, intertwines our very essences. By the wedding day, she
  will be mine completely—in ways that no dressmaker''s needle can accomplish.</i></strong>


  Dr. Sinclair looked up. "Elias Monroe. The dressmaker. Sebastian was jealous of
  him."


  "Elias Monroe?" The Professor frowned. "Does anyone know anything about him? Is
  he connected to the current Monroe Bespoke & Alterations?"


  "Did someone say Elias Monroe?"


  They both turned to find the Influencer standing in the doorway of the laboratory,
  phone in hand, eyes gleaming with interest.


  "What do you know?" Dr. Sinclair asked.


  The Influencer stepped inside, already recording. "Elias Monroe—as in Monroe Bespoke
  & Alterations, yes. That shop has been in Long Beach since 1920. And here''s the
  tea: rumor has it Elias was desperately in love with Cordelia Montrose. Like, obsessively
  in love. There were whispers that they had a brief fling before she got engaged
  to Sebastian."


  "A fling?" The Professor''s eyebrows rose.


  "Well, gossip anyway. You know how people talk. Apparently Cordelia was quite the
  flirt—just like her mother in her day. The Montrose women had that reputation."
  The Influencer scrolled through their phone. "I found some old society column mentions.
  Cordelia was seen with Elias at the theater, at gallery openings. Always explained
  away as ''consulting about her trousseau,'' but people wondered."


  Dr. Sinclair looked back at Sebastian''s note, their expression thoughtful. "So
  Sebastian knew. Or at least suspected."


  "Jealousy is a powerful motive," the Professor said slowly.'
