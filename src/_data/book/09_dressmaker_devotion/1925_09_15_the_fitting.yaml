location: Monroe Bespoke & Alterations
content: 'Cordelia Montrose stood on the fitting platform in Elias Monroe''s dressmaker
  shop, her arms extended as he took the final measurements for her wedding dress.


  "Hold still, please, Miss Montrose," he murmured, his measuring tape stretched across
  her back.


  Bust: 34 inches


  Waist: 24 inches


  Length: 62 inches from shoulder


  She appeared smaller than when he''d first measured her in July. More delicate.
  Fragile, even. Elias made a careful note—she''d lost nearly two inches from her
  waist in just six weeks.


  A sting of concern pierced his heart. All this stress that man is putting her through,
  he thought, carefully pinning the muslin mock-up at her shoulder. Sebastian Crane.


  Elias had heard the rumors—the pharmacist''s involvement with bootleggers at the
  port, his questionable business dealings, the whispers about his experiments with
  strange compounds. He was not impressed. He desperately wanted to tell Cordelia
  not to marry him, to warn her that something felt wrong about the whole arrangement.


  But instead, he just took careful measurements and adjusted pins with steady hands.


  "Oh!" Cordelia said suddenly, her face brightening. "Could you add a pocket? A hidden
  one in the seam, if you can manage it, Elias?"


  That bright laughter returned to her eyes—the spark he''d fallen in love with the
  first time she''d walked into his shop.


  "Of course," he said softly. "Every bride should have a secret or two."


  Cordelia knew of Elias''s feelings for her, though not the full extent of them.
  He reminded her of her own youthful infatuations, the silly poems she''d written,
  the innocent laughter. But she was different now. A grown woman. She''d left those
  dreamy, innocent days behind.


  A cloud passed over her beautiful face, darkening those large brown eyes.


  A bride with secrets indeed.


  Elias saw it—that shadow—and his hands stilled for a moment before continuing their
  work. He wanted to ask what troubled her. He wanted to tell her she didn''t have
  to go through with this wedding.


  But he was just the dressmaker.


  So he pinned the ivory silk and said nothing at all.'
