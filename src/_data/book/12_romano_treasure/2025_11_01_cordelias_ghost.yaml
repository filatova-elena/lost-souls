title: Cordelia's Ghost
location: Montrose Mansion Grounds, Near the Rose Garden
chapter: Romano's Treasure
content: 'The Explorer approached the old laboratory building, his flashlight cutting
  through the darkness. The night had grown cold, fog rolling in from the ocean, turning
  everything ghostly and indistinct.


  He consulted his map—a hand-drawn diagram he''d pieced together from old property
  records and bootlegging route documents. If Frankie Romano had hidden anything at
  the Montrose estate, it would be somewhere unexpected. Somewhere that looked abandoned
  but was actually—


  Movement. To his left.


  The Explorer spun, flashlight raised. Nothing. Just the overgrown garden, rose bushes
  gone wild, shadows shifting in the wind.


  Then a cold breeze passed over him—colder than natural, raising goosebumps on his
  arms. The air itself seemed to thicken, charged with something he couldn''t name.
  A presence.


  His flashlight flickered.


  And then he saw her.


  A woman stood in the garden path, no more than ten feet away. She wore a light blue
  dress in the style of the 1920s—dropped waist, delicate lace at the collar. Her
  blonde hair was styled in the fashion of the era, pinned in soft waves close to
  her head. Her features were delicate, almost ethereal. But she was translucent,
  glowing faintly in the darkness, as if lit from within by moonlight.


  The Explorer''s breath caught.


  She stared at him with an expression of desperate hope, her eyes bright with tears.


  "Thomas?" Her voice was a whisper, distant and close all at once. "Is that you?"


  The Explorer couldn''t move. Couldn''t speak.


  "You came back!" The ghost—because what else could she be—stepped closer, her movements
  fluid and strange, not quite touching the ground. "I thought you would! I was losing
  hope, but in my visions you were there—alive, lost at sea, but alive. And now you''re
  here. You came back to me. Oh Thomas, how glad I am to see you!"


  She reached out her hand toward him, her face radiant with joy and relief.


  The Explorer stumbled backward, his rational mind screaming. He squeezed his eyes
  shut, pressing his palms against his temples.


  Not real. Stress. Exhaustion. Power of suggestion. All these ghost stories are getting
  to me.


  When he opened his eyes, she was gone.


  Just the garden. Just the wind. Just the fog rolling through the overgrown roses.


  "Jesus," he muttered, his heart still racing. He wiped his forehead with a shaking
  hand. "Ghosts. Right. I''m seeing things."


  But something about her voice had felt... familiar. Like an echo of something he''d
  heard before. Something he should remember but couldn''t quite grasp.


  Thomas. She''d called him Thomas.


  The Explorer shook his head sharply, forcing himself to focus. He pulled out his
  map again, consulting it by flashlight.


  "Rose garden planters," he read aloud, his voice steadier now. "Should be just about...
  here."


  He moved deeper into the garden, stepping over broken trellises and tangled vines,
  looking for the old stone planters that marked the corners of what had once been
  an elaborate formal rose garden.'
