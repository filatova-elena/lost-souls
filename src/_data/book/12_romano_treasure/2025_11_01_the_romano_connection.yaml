  taking the other''s measure.


  What is he doing here?


  The thought occurred to both of them simultaneously.


  Does he know about the Romano treasure?


  The Art Collector''s family name carried weight in Long Beach—but not the kind he
  preferred to advertise. His great-great-grandfather was Frankie "the Coast" Romano,
  the notorious rum-runner who''d controlled bootlegging operations at the Port of
  Long Beach during Prohibition.


  The Romano family had it all in the 1920s through the 1950s: money, power, connections,
  glamour. Nightclubs where Hollywood starlets danced. Politicians in their pocket.
  A mansion in the hills. They were untouchable.


  Until they weren''t.


  The IRS investigations began in the 1960s and dragged on through the 1980s. The
  government seized everything—the nightclubs, the properties, the legitimate businesses
  Frankie had used to launder his empire. Bank accounts frozen. Assets auctioned.
  The Romano name became synonymous with scandal and downfall.


  But there were rumors. Whispers passed down through the family like heirlooms. Hidden
  wealth that had escaped the IRS. Gold, cash, jewelry—secreted away before the feds
  came knocking. The legendary "Romano treasure."


  The Art Collector learned the art world by necessity, selling off salvaged family
  pieces to survive—a Tiffany lamp here, a piece of art deco furniture there. Slowly
  liquidating what little remained of the Romano legacy.


  But one piece he could never bring himself to sell.


  An ornate glass bottle. Venetian glass from the 1920s, exquisite workmanship. The
  body was clear crystal with delicate white and golden accents swirling through it
  like frozen smoke. The stopper was heart-shaped—an unusual choice—and when it caught
  the light at certain angles, golden sparkles danced inside the glass as if the bottle
  itself were alive.


  It had belonged to Frankie Romano. Or so the Art Collector believed. Sat on his
  desk in his office at the port.


  When the Art Collector heard about the investigation at the old Montrose mansion—where
  his ancestor Frankie had done business in the 1920s—he couldn''t resist.


  Maybe the treasure was real. Maybe it was here.'
