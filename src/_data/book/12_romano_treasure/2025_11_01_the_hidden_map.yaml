title: The Hidden Map
location: Montrose Mansion, Various Rooms
chapter: Romano's Treasure
content: 'The Explorer moved through the mansion methodically, noting in his notebook
  pieces that might have belonged to the Romanos:


  Three bears in birch forest - Russian school, late 19th/early 20th century - undoubtedly
  from the Romano collection.


  He moved to the next piece.


  Oil on canvas, 30x40" - flamenco dancer in red dress - Spanish, definitely Andalusian
  influence - I read about this piece before, highly likely that it once was purchased
  by Frankie Romano himself.


  How had Romano pieces ended up here? The Explorer had a theory: When the IRS investigations
  began in the 1960s, someone in the family had hidden the most valuable items in
  this abandoned property. The Montrose mansion had been empty since the deaths in
  1925, sitting in legal limbo. A perfect hiding place.


  He continued along the wall, documenting each piece methodically.


  And then he stopped.


  Oil on canvas, 36x28" - woman at table with wine glass - unsigned -


  The Explorer leaned closer, his pulse quickening.


  The woman in the painting wore an elegant evening gown in deep jewel tones. She
  held a wine glass delicately in her hand, lifted to her face. But she wasn''t drinking
  from it. She was gazing into it—looking deeply into the glass itself, as if trying
  to read something in its depths, as if the wine held secrets or visions.


  And there, behind the painting, there was a glimpse of something white. A note!


  <strong><i>Moved the collection to the M. house. Everything''s secure. If the boys
  ever need to find it, I left them a map. Tell them to find the lady with the wine
  glass—watch how she looks inside. That''s the trick. Purple dreams and golden promises—that''s
  where the real treasure sleeps.</i></strong>


  The lady with the wine glass—watch how she looks inside.


  "It''s a riddle," he whispered. "Look inside."


  But inside what?


  He moved through the room more carefully now, searching. Looking for something purple
  with golden highlights. Something that matched the cryptic description.


  And there—in the corner, on a side table beneath a dust sheet—he found it.


  A vase. Large, ornate, unmistakably Venetian. Deep purple glass with golden highlights
  swirling through it like captured starlight.


  The Explorer approached it slowly, his hands trembling.


  Purple dreams and golden promises.


  This was it.


  And the riddle: look inside. Wedged deep inside the narrow neck, he caught a glimpse
  of something pale.


  Paper.


  "No way," he breathed.


  He looked around quickly, making sure he was alone, then carefully worked his fingers
  into the vase''s opening. The paper was old, brittle—had to be from the 1920s or
  earlier. He had to be gentle. Slowly, painstakingly, he coaxed it out.


  A map.


  Hand-drawn on yellowed paper, the ink faded but still legible. A rough sketch of
  the mansion grounds, focusing on the garden area. And there, marked with a bold
  red X circled multiple times: a spot near the rose bushes.


  Below the map, instructions in Frankie''s handwriting:


  <strong><i>40 paces north from the iron gate


  9 paces west


  Under the lady''s feet</i></strong>


  The Explorer stared at the map, barely breathing.


  This was it. The Romano treasure. Real. Here.


  The Explorer headed for the door, trying to walk calmly, trying not to run.'
