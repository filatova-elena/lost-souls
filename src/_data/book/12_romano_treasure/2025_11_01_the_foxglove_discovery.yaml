location: Montrose Mansion Abandoned Laboratory
content: 'The Botany Professor stepped forward, adjusting his glasses. "May I?"


  The Art Collector handed him the bottle carefully.


  He removed the heart-shaped stopper and brought the opening to his nose, inhaling
  deeply. His eyes widened.


  "Rose otto," he said immediately. "Faint, but unmistakable. There''s also..." he
  sniffed again, "valerian, I think. And something else. Something I can''t quite
  identify." He looked up. "This bottle definitely contained Sebastian''s elixir once."


  "But what was in it?" the Doctor asked, moving closer. "What killed them?"


  The Professor shook his head. "We''d need to analyze the residue, if there is any."


  At that moment, another voice emerged from the depths of the laboratory, holding
  a yellowed piece of paper with careful fingers.


  "Found something of interest," he said, his voice tight with excitement. "A note.
  From Dr. Thaddeus Crane to his brother Sebastian, requesting him to order <strong>foxglove</strong>
  for his cardiac patients." He looked up at the assembled group. "I cross-checked
  this with the pharmacy purchase records the Fiduciary kindly provided, and it''s
  right there in the ledger. September 1925. Ten ounces of dried <strong>foxglove</strong>
  leaves."


  The Botany Professor straightened immediately. "<strong>Foxglove. Digitalis purpurea.</strong>"


  "That''s poisonous, isn''t it?" the Doctor asked, though his tone suggested he already
  knew the answer.


  "In the right concentrations, it was actually used as a treatment for cardiac conditions
  in the 1920s," the Professor explained, his voice taking on the cadence of a lecture.
  "Digitalis helps regulate heart rhythm, strengthens contractions. But you''re correct—foxglove
  is highly toxic in even slightly elevated doses. The margin between therapeutic
  and lethal is razor-thin. Symptoms include nausea, visual disturbances, cardiac
  arrhythmia, and ultimately, complete cardiac and renal failure."


  "That would definitely match the autopsy findings I found in Silas''s records,"
  the Mortician said, appearing in the laboratory doorway with her usual unsettling
  calm. She held a leather-bound notebook—Silas Blackwell''s private notes. "Both
  Sebastian and Cordelia showed signs of hepatic damage, cardiac tissue deterioration,
  and extensive kidney necrosis. Consistent with digitalis poisoning. Cordelia''s
  was chronic—accumulated over weeks. Sebastian''s was acute, as if he''d received
  a much larger dose all at once."


  "But how did foxglove get into the elixir?" the Doctor wondered aloud. "Sebastian
  was meticulous about his formulas. He documented everything. There''s no mention
  of foxglove in any of his notebooks about the Elixir of Eternal Love."


  "Maybe he didn''t know it was in there," the Professor said slowly.


  A heavy silence fell over the laboratory as the implications sank in.


  At that moment, the Art Collector—who had been standing near the laboratory door,
  half-listening while examining the Venetian bottle in the fading light—noticed movement
  in the darkness beyond the trees.


  A figure. Digging.


  Taking great care that no one noticed his departure, the Art Collector hurried toward
  the dark figure.'
