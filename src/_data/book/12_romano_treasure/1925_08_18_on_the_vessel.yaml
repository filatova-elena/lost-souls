content: '<i>A potion as delicate and profound as the Elixir of Eternal Love deserves
  a container worthy of its contents. I cannot serve transcendence in common glass.


  Found it today at Frankie''s Harbor Import & Trading Company—a Venetian masterpiece.
  Clear crystal with white accents and flecks of gold suspended in the glass like
  stars. The stopper is heart-shaped, an exquisite touch. When it catches the light
  properly, golden sparkles dance inside as if the bottle itself contains magic.</i>'
