title: Sebastian's Vessel
location: Montrose Mansion Abandoned Laboratory
chapter: Romano's Treasure
content: 'The Art Collector found himself drawn to an old structure behind the main
  house—what must have been Sebastian Crane''s private laboratory. The Doctor and
  the Botany Professor were already inside, carefully examining dusty shelves lined
  with amber bottles and rusted equipment.


  That''s when the temperature dropped.


  The cold came suddenly, intensely—the kind of cold that has nothing to do with weather.
  The Art Collector''s breath misted in the air. His skin prickled with instinctive
  fear.


  And then he saw it.


  A figure materializing in the dark garden by the laboratory. Translucent, shimmering…
  A man, tall and dark-haired, wearing what looked like a waistcoat from the 1920s.
  His form flickered like a candle flame—growing taller, then shrinking, then stretching
  again as if he couldn''t quite remember what size he''d been when alive.


  The ghost''s arm extended toward the Art Collector. Toward his bag. Toward the Venetian
  bottle inside.


  The Art Collector froze, his hand instinctively clutching the leather satchel.


  "Don''t move."


  Margo Laveau appeared in the doorway as if she''d materialized from thin air—though
  the Art Collector suspected she''d simply moved very quietly.


  "Back away slowly," she said softly.


  The Art Collector obeyed, stepping backward through the trees, watching.


  Margo moved forward, positioning herself directly in front of the ghost. She closed
  her eyes, her breathing slowing, becoming rhythmic. Her lips moved, whispering words
  the Art Collector didn''t recognize.


  Finally, Margo opened her eyes. The ghost faded slowly, like morning mist burning
  off in sunlight, until only the normal autumn chill remained.


  Margo turned to the Art Collector, her expression grave.


  "That was Sebastian Crane," she said. "He''s been trapped here for a century, and
  he won''t rest until something is resolved."


  "What does he want?" the Art Collector asked, though part of him already knew.


  "You have something that belonged to him. Something he calls ''the vessel.'' He''s
  been searching for it since his death." Margo''s dark eyes fixed on the Art Collector''s
  bag. "The glass bottle you carry. That''s what he needs."


  Reluctantly, the Art Collector pulled out the Venetian bottle—clear glass with white
  and golden accents, the heart-shaped stopper catching the dim laboratory light.'
