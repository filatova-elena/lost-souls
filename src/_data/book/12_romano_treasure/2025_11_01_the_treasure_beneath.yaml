title: The Treasure Beneath
location: Montrose Mansion Grounds, Near the Rose Garden
content: 'The Art Collector moved quietly through the overgrown garden towards the
  Explorer.


  The Explorer knelt in the dirt near the old stone planters, digging with a folding
  shovel, his flashlight propped against a rose bush. He was working methodically,
  carefully, the way someone searches when they know they''re close but not exactly
  where.


  The Art Collector''s heart sank.


  The Art Collector''s mind raced through his options. Then he said quietly: "You''re
  in the wrong spot."


  The Explorer spun around, shovel raised defensively, his face a mixture of shock
  and anger. "What the hell? What are YOU doing here?"


  "I thought," the Art Collector said carefully, "that if we both want what''s buried
  here, and we''re both descendants of people connected to this mansion, we might
  consider being strategic instead of stupid."


  "Strategic how?"


  "I know something you don''t."


  "And what''s that?"


  "Where to dig. I know Frankie and my family better than you and I know exactly where
  to dig unlike yourself. Now you can spend days toiling over the garden, or we split
  the treasure fifty-fifty."


  The Explorer considered this offer. He knew who the Art Collector was, a descendant
  of the Romano family. He might know a marker or a special sign that only a Romano
  would know.


  "Fine, agreed. Now where to dig?"


  "Under the lady''s feet," the Art Collector murmured, looking at the planter. The
  stone urn sat on a base carved with classical figures—nymphs and goddesses dancing
  in relief. One goddess stood slightly apart from the others, her bare feet clearly
  visible in the carved stone. "That was in Frankie''s notes."


  "That''s it," the Explorer breathed.


  They both knelt and began to dig, the Explorer with his folding shovel, the Art
  Collector using his hands to scoop away the loose dirt the Explorer had already
  displaced nearby.


  Then—


  Thunk.


  Metal. Something solid buried just beneath the surface.'
