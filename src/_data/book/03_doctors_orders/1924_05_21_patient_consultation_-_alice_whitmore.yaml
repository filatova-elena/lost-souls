  ***Initial Assessment: Miss Alice Whitmore***

  *Patient presented by family following what they describe as "episodes of hysteria" beginning March 18th, coinciding with news of her brother's death at sea.*

  *Dr. Morrison (predictably) diagnosed acute hysteria and prescribed bed rest, bromides, and the usual tedious regiment of "calm activities." The family reports no improvement. Morrison suggested commitment to a sanitarium if symptoms persist. Typical.*

  **Patient's Account:** *Miss Whitmore describes vivid dreams—visions, she insists—beginning the night she received news of her brother's loss. The dreams are disturbingly specific: a woman drowning in blood (she identifies the woman as her friend, Miss Cordelia Montrose), the sound of an infant crying, a sense of overwhelming dread.*

  *She reports physical symptoms: rapid heartbeat, cold sweats, the sensation of "knowing" things she shouldn't know.*

  **My Assessment:** *This is not hysteria.*

  *The medical establishment, in its typical narrow-mindedness, dismisses anything it cannot measure or classify as female neurosis. But I have studied the work of the Society for Psychical Research, the experiments at Duke University. There are documented cases of precognitive ability, of sensitivity to events beyond normal perception.*

  *Miss Whitmore exhibits classic markers of genuine psychic sensitivity:*

  *• Visions triggered by emotional trauma (the death/loss of her brother)*

  *• Specific, verifiable details (not vague premonitions)*

  *• Physical manifestations consistent with heightened sensory perception*

  *• Distress at being disbelieved*

  **Treatment Plan:** *I will monitor her carefully. Most importantly, I will believe her—something no other physician in this provincial town is capable of doing.*

  *If her visions prove accurate, I may be witnessing something quite extraordinary. And I intend to be the physician who finally brings scientific legitimacy to the study of psychic phenomena.*

  *History will remember my name for this.*
