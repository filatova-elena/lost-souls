  ***The Whitmore Arrangement***

  *The family has agreed to weekly private consultations under the framework of a psychoneurological research study. I've explained to them—in terms they could comprehend—that Miss Whitmore's symptoms suggest a phenomenon at the intersection of neurology and psychology.*

  *Diseases of the mind and diseases of the body are merely different manifestations of the same fundamental truth about human existence. The body is the mind made flesh; the mind is the body made conscious. Descartes was wrong about his dualism, but it takes a mind of rare sophistication to understand why. The nervous system is not merely a biological structure—it is the very architecture of consciousness, the material expression of thought itself. A concept, I'm certain, that exists entirely beyond Morrison's pedestrian understanding. The man probably still believes the soul resides in the pineal gland.*

  *Dr. James taught us at Hopkins that psychology and physiology are inextricably linked—though I suspect even he would not have pursued the full implications as I intend to.*

  *The Whitmores are desperate enough to embrace my approach. Morrison's crude recommendation of institutionalization terrified them—the man treats medicine like carpentry.*

  *If her abilities prove genuine—and I suspect they will—I will establish an entirely new field of medical inquiry.*
