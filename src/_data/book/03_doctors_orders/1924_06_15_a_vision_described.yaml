  ![Alice describing her psychic visions](../assets/alice_psychic.png)

  Alice Whitmore sat in the leather chair across from Dr. Thaddeus Crane's desk, her hands folded in her lap. Her posture was impeccable—back straight, ankles crossed, chin level—the product of years of finishing school training. Only the slight tremor in her fingers betrayed her.

  "Tell me about last night's vision," Thaddeus said, his pen poised over his notebook.

  Alice took a measured breath. When she spoke, her voice was steady, precise. "It was more vivid than the others. More... complete."

  "Go on."

  "Cordelia was standing at the edge of a cliff. I could feel the wind—sharp, cold, coming from the ocean. She was wearing a white dress." Alice's eyes remained open, focused on some middle distance. "There was a crowd of people behind her. I couldn't see their faces clearly, but I could hear them."

  "What were they saying?"

  "They were chanting. Not words exactly, but... pressure. Urging her forward. Jump, jump, jump." Alice's refined composure cracked slightly. "The voices got louder. Louder. Until they were deafening, unbearable. And then—"

  She paused, and Thaddeus noticed how she gripped her gloved hands together more tightly.

  "Then they stopped. Complete silence. And in that silence, I heard a baby crying. Not a normal cry—this was desperate. Piercing. The kind of sound that makes your heart stop."

  Thaddeus leaned forward slightly, his pen moving across the page. "Describe the quality of the sound."

  Only Alice would understand why he asked such a strange question. Only she would answer it seriously.

  "Haunting," she said. "Like the baby knew something terrible was about to happen. The cry got louder, more frantic, and then—" Her voice dropped to barely a whisper. "Then the baby just... burst. Exploded into pieces. And there was blood everywhere. On the rocks, in the water, on Cordelia's white dress. So much blood. Even the skies looked red."

  She closed her eyes finally, and Thaddeus saw her swallow hard.

  "When I woke up, I could still smell it. Copper. Salt. Death."

  The room was silent except for the scratch of Thaddeus's pen. He wrote quickly, capturing every detail while they were fresh.

  "Miss Whitmore," he said finally, setting down his pen, "have you spoken to Miss Montrose recently?"

  "Not in months. Not since..." Alice opened her eyes. "Not since Thomas died. I tried to write to her, but my letters went unanswered. When I inquired at the Montrose house, her mother was quite short with me. She said Cordelia was traveling abroad, that post might be irregular. She suggested I stop writing altogether and simply wait for her return."

  "Yet you continue to see her in your visions."

  "Yes." Alice's intelligence shone through her distress. "That's what troubles me most, Dr. Crane. These aren't memories or anxieties about our friendship. These feel like warnings. As if something terrible is going to happen to her, and I'm being shown it so I can... what? Stop it? I don't even know if that's possible."

  Thaddeus regarded her carefully. Another woman might be hysterical after such a vision—weeping, incoherent. But Alice sat before him analyzing her own psychic experiences with remarkable clarity, trying to understand their meaning and purpose.

  Extraordinary.

  "The baby in your vision," he said. "Do you believe it's literal or symbolic?"

  Alice met his eyes directly. "I'm terrified it's all real—but perhaps metaphorical. Amplified, like reflections in a carnival mirror. The truth, but distorted."

  She added quietly: "Dr. Crane? Do you think I'm mad?"

  Alice's questions and observations made him certain she was more than just another patient. But he couldn't tell her all of it just yet.

  "I think," he said carefully, "that what you're experiencing is extraordinary. You are certainly not mad, Alice," he added softly.

  Alice breathed a sigh of relief and even smiled a little. Something shifted in his chest at that small smile—professional detachment giving way to something more dangerous. Her eyes shone with an intelligence that recognized intelligence in himself, he was certain.

  "Thank you, Dr. Crane! I will see you next week!"
