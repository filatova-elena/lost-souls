  Thomas Whitmore stood before his childhood home, his sea bag slung over his shoulder, his heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and dread.

  Something was wrong.

  The curtains were drawn tight, the windows dark. The grass had grown wild and overgrown, reaching nearly to his knees. Ever since his father lost his fortune back in 1918, the house had been slowly deteriorating—the paint peeling, the fence sagging—but his mother had always maintained appearances. And Alice... Alice had always kept the curtains fresh and the windows bright.

  It had always felt like home.

  Now it looked abandoned.

  Thomas knocked. No answer. He knocked again, harder. Finally, he heard shuffling footsteps inside.

  The door opened a crack, revealing an old woman with gray hair and sunken eyes. She stared at him without recognition.

  "Mother?" Thomas's voice cracked. "Mother, it's me. It's Thomas."

  "Thomas?" She blinked slowly, her hollow eyes trying to focus. "Thomas?"

  "Yes, Mother. Don't you know me?"

  "Thomas?" Her voice was barely a whisper. Recognition began to dawn, followed by horror. "Thomas? How can that be? The telegram said... We thought you were dead."

  "It's a long story, Mother. I survived the wreck. It took me two years to get home, but I'm here now. I'm alive." He reached for her hand. "Where is Alice? Where's Father?"

  His mother's face crumpled. She began to sob—deep, broken sounds that seemed to come from somewhere beyond grief.

  "Mother?" Thomas felt ice spreading through his chest. "What happened? Where is Alice?"

  But his mother could only shake her head and weep.
