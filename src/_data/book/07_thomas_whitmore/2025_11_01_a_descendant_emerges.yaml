title: A Descendant Emerges
location: Montrose Mansion Main Room
content: 'The Influencer drifted over to the Heiress, phone ready, hoping for content
  gold.


  "Who''s that over there?" He gestured subtly toward a young man with dark hair wearing
  a red sweater. "Looks like he could be a Montrose. One of your cousins?"


  "No one important," the Heiress replied, her tone clipped. "A baker from down the
  street. I''m not sure what he''s doing here." She shot an annoyed glance toward
  Grandmother. "Ever since this investigation began, all kinds of people have been
  showing up at the mansion. There''s no telling what secrets they''re hiding."


  Why is she in charge anyway? the Heiress thought bitterly. This is my house. I should
  be leading this investigation.


  "But see that gentleman over there?" The Heiress lowered her voice, leaning closer.
  "The one with the easy smile and the traveler''s fedora?"


  The Influencer''s eyes lit up. This was more like it.


  "That''s a Whitmore," the Heiress whispered. "Did you know that Thomas Whitmore—Cordelia''s
  brief romance in 1923 and Alice''s brother—didn''t actually perish at sea like everyone
  said?"


  The Influencer leaned in, practically salivating.


  "He came back to Long Beach in 1926, only to find both his sister and his former
  lover dead. His parents died soon after—from grief, people said. Thomas signed a
  contract with a merchant ship and sailed away, never to return to Long Beach again."
  She paused for dramatic effect. "But it''s said he had not one, but two wives overseas.
  And many offspring."


  "And that''s one of them?" The Influencer''s eyes widened.


  "In the flesh. Handsome, isn''t he? No wonder Cordelia was in love with Thomas."


  The Influencer''s phone was already recording.'
