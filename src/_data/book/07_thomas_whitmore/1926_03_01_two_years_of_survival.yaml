title: Two Years of Survival
location: Pacific Ocean
content: '<strong>Thomas''s Account</strong>


  When the Pacific Dawn went down in March 1924, Thomas was among a small group of
  survivors who clung to debris in the typhoon. They drifted for nearly thirty days
  with nothing to eat but raw fish and nothing to drink but rainwater caught in their
  cupped hands. Many died of exposure, dehydration, and madness.


  The five who survived finally washed up on a remote, uninhabited island in the Pacific—so
  isolated that no ships passed, no rescue came. For the next two years, they survived
  on tropical fruit, fish, and hope. They built shelters from palm fronds. They kept
  a signal fire burning. They waited.


  In July 1926, a British survey vessel finally spotted their smoke.


  Thomas had written home immediately—surely his family had been told he was dead.
  Surely they''d been grieving all this time. He needed them to know he was alive,
  that he was coming home.


  He received no response. But mail in the Pacific was irregular, unreliable. Rather
  than wait, he''d booked passage on the first ship to San Francisco and made his
  way down the coast to Long Beach.


  Home.


  Except home was gone. And so, he would learn, was everyone he''d ever loved.'
