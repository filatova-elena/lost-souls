title: Cordelia Montrose's Examination
location: Blackwell & Sons Mortuary
content: 'Another body arrived in the early hours of the morning, just as dawn was
  breaking over Long Beach.


  Cordelia Montrose. Female, twenty-six years of age. Found deceased in her bed. Heart
  failure, the family had said.


  Silas pulled on fresh gloves and began his examination, his movements methodical
  despite the exhaustion pulling at him.


  Another body, another young woman. Cordelia Montrose, everyone knew the Montrose
  name and Cordelia had a reputation of a local beauty. And here she was—the grayish
  pallor, the slightly bluish tinge to her lips, death took its toll.


  He began taking notes:


  <div class="autopsy-notes"><strong>Signs of systemic poisoning. Hepatic damage present.
  Cardiac tissue shows chronic deterioration. Kidney damage extensive but appears
  gradual. Gastric lining shows signs of prolonged exposure to toxic substance.</strong>


  Assessment: Poisoning—chronic.


  Silas set down his pen and stared at his three sets of notes laid out before him
  on his desk. Too many coincidences, too many similarities…</div>


  His thoughts were interrupted by a messenger appearing in the doorway—well-dressed,
  unfamiliar. "Letter for Mr. Blackwell."


  "From?"


  "No return address, sir." The man set the envelope on the desk and left quickly,
  his footsteps echoing down the stairs.


  Silas stared at the envelope. Expensive cream-colored paper. Heavy stock. The kind
  wealthy families used.


  He opened it slowly.


  Inside was a single card with a brief note in elegant script:


  <div class="card-message"><em>For your discretion.</em></div>


  Beneath it, folded carefully, was a five-hundred-dollar bill.


  Five hundred dollars.


  Silas looked from the money to his detailed notes. To the three death certificates
  waiting to be filled out.


  The Montroses. It had to be. People whispered about that family—how they protected
  their reputation at any cost.


  Then Silas Blackwell picked up his pen and wrote:


  <div class="death-certificates"><strong>Alice Whitmore - Cause of Death: Accidental
  fall


  Sebastian Crane - Cause of Death: Accidental poisoning (suspected self-administered)


  Cordelia Montrose - Cause of Death: Heart failure</strong></div>


  He sealed each certificate carefully, his hands steady, his conscience quieter than
  perhaps it should have been.'
