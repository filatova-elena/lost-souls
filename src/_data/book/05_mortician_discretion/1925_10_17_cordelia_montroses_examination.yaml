  Another body arrived in the early hours of the morning, just as dawn was breaking over Long Beach.

  Cordelia Montrose. Female, twenty-six years of age. Found deceased in her bed. Heart failure, the family had said.

  Silas pulled on fresh gloves and began his examination, his movements methodical despite the exhaustion pulling at him.

  Another body, another young woman. Cordelia Montrose, everyone knew the Montrose name and Cordelia had a reputation of a local beauty. And here she was—the grayish pallor, the slightly bluish tinge to her lips, death took its toll.

  He began taking notes:

  **Signs of systemic poisoning. Hepatic damage present. Cardiac tissue shows chronic deterioration. Kidney damage extensive but appears gradual. Gastric lining shows signs of prolonged exposure to toxic substance.**

  Assessment: Poisoning—chronic.

  Silas set down his pen and stared at his three sets of notes laid out before him on his desk. Too many coincidences, too many similarities…

  His thoughts were interrupted by a messenger appearing in the doorway—well-dressed, unfamiliar. "Letter for Mr. Blackwell."

  "From?"

  "No return address, sir." The man set the envelope on the desk and left quickly, his footsteps echoing down the stairs.

  Silas stared at the envelope. Expensive cream-colored paper. Heavy stock. The kind wealthy families used.

  He opened it slowly.

  Inside was a single card with a brief note in elegant script:

  *For your discretion.*

  Beneath it, folded carefully, was a five-hundred-dollar bill.

  Five hundred dollars.

  Silas looked from the money to his detailed notes. To the three death certificates signed by Dr. Thaddeus Crane, each with causes of death that didn't match what the bodies revealed.

  Alice Whitmore—Cause of Death: Accidental fall. But his notes showed blunt force trauma from a heavy object.

  Sebastian Crane—Cause of Death: Suspected accidental poisoning. But his notes showed systematic organ damage from concentrated toxin.

  Cordelia Montrose—Cause of Death: Heart failure. But his notes showed chronic poisoning over weeks.

  The Montroses. It had to be. People whispered about that family—how they protected their reputation at any cost.

  Silas stared at the money. At his notes. At the signed certificates.

  He could report the discrepancies. He could go to the authorities. But five hundred dollars was a fortune. And who would believe a mortician over a respected physician?

  Silas put the money in his safe. The dead were already dead after all and he had a family to feed.
