title: Alice Whitmore's Examination
location: Blackwell & Sons Mortuary
content: 'Silas Blackwell stood in the preparation room of Blackwell & Sons Mortuary,
  his rubber gloves pristine, his dark hair carefully slicked back with pomade, when
  they brought her in.


  Alice Whitmore. Female, twenty-four years of age. Deceased at the scene.


  He''d been doing this work for fifteen years—since returning from the War with hands
  too steady and a mind too comfortable with death to do anything else.


  But when he unwrapped the pristine white sheet covering Alice Whitmore, something
  in his chest tightened.


  She looked young. Peaceful, almost. Her features were delicate, refined—the kind
  of face that belonged in a painting, not on his steel examination table. In death,
  she looked like an angel.


  Except for the crushed wound at the back of her skull, the matted dark hair, the
  red that had seeped and dried.


  "Too young," Silas muttered, and began his work.


  He took meticulous notes, his pen moving across the paper with the precision of
  a man who understood that details mattered—even if no one else would read them.


  <div class="autopsy-notes"><strong>Blunt force trauma to the occipital region. Skull
  fracture—depressed.</strong>


  He examined her carefully, turning her head to measure the wound''s dimensions,
  checking her arms, her legs, her torso.


  <strong>No defensive wounds on hands or forearms. No bruising to extremities. No
  signs of struggle.</strong>


  Silas paused, his pen hovering over the page.


  A fall from the top of a staircase—which is what the police report claimed—would
  leave evidence. Bruises along the body from tumbling. Scraped palms from trying
  to catch oneself. Multiple points of trauma from hitting the steps.


  Alice Whitmore had none of that.


  Just one perfect, crushing blow to the back of her head.


  He examined the fracture pattern more closely, angling the light to see the depression
  clearly. The shape was wrong for a fall—too concentrated, too deep. This was the
  kind of damage you saw when something heavy connected with force and intention.


  <strong>Fracture pattern inconsistent with accidental fall. Trauma angle suggests
  horizontal strike from behind. Heavy object likely. Recommend further investigation.</strong></div>


  "Shady business," he muttered to no one.


  He covered her face gently with a clean cloth and began preparing the embalming
  solution.'
