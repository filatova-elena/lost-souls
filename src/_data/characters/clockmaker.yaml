background: 'You''re a clockmaker and horologist—obsessed with time, timing, and the
  mechanisms that measure it. But you''re not just about clocks. You study astronomical
  timing, consciousness, synchronicities. You believe the universe has patterns, that
  timing matters, that mystical experiences are real phenomena we''re only beginning
  to measure. For years, you''ve been obsessing over an antique **pocket watch** from
  1925. You inherited it, been trying to fix/restore it, studying every detail. Inside,
  you discovered an engraving: **September 4th** and astronomical symbols you recognized
  immediately—the **Jupiter-Venus conjunction**. You calculated it. **September 4,
  1925**, at 6:14 AM. A rare conjunction that happens once in decades. Someone thought
  this date was important enough to engrave it permanently. The Influencer featured
  you and your **pocket watch** in their "Long Beach Urban Legends" series. You explained
  the conjunction, the timing, the mystery. They were skeptical (as always—they think
  your helmet project is pseudoscience too). But the episode led you both here, to
  this mansion, to **October 1925 deaths** that happened exactly five weeks after
  that sacred conjunction. This can''t be a coincidence. The universe doesn''t work
  that way.'

strategy: Your 📜 Expert History skill lets you read clues others can't—historical
  documents, timelines, artifact authentication. Your 🔮 Basic Spiritual skill gives
  you some access to vision clues. But you won't be able to read everything. Find
  players whose skills complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  influencer: Your friend and collaborator—they featured you and the pocket watch
    in their Long Beach mysteries series. They thought the conjunction theory was
    a stretch, but they're here now, aren't they?
  professor: You're obsessed with timing. They're obsessed with plants. Different
    fixations, but you're both trying to decode what was happening in 1925—and their
    research might explain why that date mattered.
  astrologer: They understand exactly what the Jupiter-Venus conjunction symbols on
    your pocket watch mean. If anyone can help you decode why that date was engraved,
    it's them.
