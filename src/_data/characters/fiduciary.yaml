background: You work for a generational wealth management firm that has managed the
  estates of the **Montrose, Crane, and Whitmore families** for decades. These properties
  have been a professional frustration—the haunted mansion has been an eyesore and
  wasted asset for generations. While researching the Montrose estate, you traced
  the lineage to find the Heiress and contacted her about the unclaimed property.
  You hoped she'd take possession and finally do something with it. During your research,
  you discovered records about the **Crane family name change**—they became the **Sinclairs**
  in the 1960s, apparently for political reasons. You found a box of old papers connecting
  Dr. Thaddeus Crane to a brother named **Sebastian Crane**. You've never heard of
  **Sebastian Crane**, and you've been managing the estates for years! Now you've
  noticed some disturbing inconsistencies in **death records from 1925**, and you're
  determined to finally understand what happened. You've heard rumors about the ghosts
  haunting the mansion, and you can't shake off a strange feeling.

strategy: Your ⚖️ Expert Legal skill lets you read clues others can't—estate documents,
  financial records, trust papers. Your ⚕️ Basic Medical skill gives you some access
  to forensic and clinical clues. But you won't be able to read everything. Find players
  whose skills complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  baker: They showed up to this investigation with homemade bread and a story about
    an old diary. Something about them feels oddly relevant to the estate records
    you've been combing through, though you can't quite put your finger on why.
  doctor: You sent them a box of old family papers recently. Their reaction told you
    there's more to the Crane family story than what's in your files. You want to
    know what they found.
  journalist: They've been covering the Montrose family for years and they've noticed
    the same gaps in the records that you have. You have the estate documents. They
    have the public record. Together you might see the full picture.
