background: |-
  Your family name carries weight in Long Beach—but not the kind you'd prefer. Your great-great-grandfather was **Frankie "the Coast" Romano**, the notorious rum runner who controlled **bootlegging operations** at the Port of Long Beach during Prohibition. The Romano family had it all in the 1920s-1950s: money, power, connections, Hollywood parties, political influence. But then came the IRS investigations in the 1960s-1980s. The government seized everything. Except, there are rumors about hidden wealth that escaped the IRS. The legendary "**Romano Treasure**." Is it real? Or just a desperate family myth? You learned the art world through necessity—selling salvaged family pieces to survive. But you discovered you actually had talent for it. You've built a legitimate art dealing business and made real money again. Though you still dabble in questionable provenance and black market connections when profitable. Old habits die hard. When you heard about the investigation at the old **Montrose mansion**—where your ancestor Frankie did business in the 1920s—you couldn't resist. Maybe the treasure is real. Maybe it's here.
objectives:
  main: main_quest
  private: major_romano_treasure
strategy: Your knowledge of the Romano family gives you complete understanding of their smuggling operations. Your Expert Art
  skill helps with art authentication and provenance. Your family knowledge is key—others' exploration and estate records
  can help locate what you're seeking.
relationships:
  explorer: They're also searching for the Romano treasure. Share information—your family knowledge combined with their exploration
    skills could help locate what you're both seeking.
  fiduciary: They manage old estates and have information about business dealings between the Romanos and other families.
    Their records could help identify where assets might have been hidden.
  doctor: You heard rumors that your ancestor did business with a doctor or pharmacist back in the 1920s. Their family records
    might reveal those business connections.
  professor: The Romano operation imported exotic goods. They can identify what your family was smuggling and help you understand
    the full scope of the operation.
  fixer: They've done legal work for your family for years—cleaning up after the IRS seizures. You trust them, or at least you think you can control them. But they might have found something in those old case files that you don't know about.
  portraitartist: You're both art experts but from different worlds—you see provenance and value, they see emotion and intention. Together you can decode the full story behind any artifact. But you might clash over whether art is about money or feeling.
