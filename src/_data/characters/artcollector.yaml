background: 'Your family name carries weight in Long Beach—but not the kind you''d
  prefer. Your great-great-grandfather was **Frankie "the Coast" Romano**, the notorious
  rum runner who controlled **bootlegging operations** at the Port of Long Beach during
  Prohibition. The Romano family had it all in the 1920s-1950s: money, power, connections,
  Hollywood parties, political influence. But then came the IRS investigations in
  the 1960s-1980s. The government seized everything. Except, there are rumors about
  hidden wealth that escaped the IRS. The legendary "**Romano Treasure**." Is it real?
  Or just a desperate family myth? You learned the art world through necessity—selling
  salvaged family pieces to survive. But you discovered you actually had talent for
  it. You''ve built a legitimate art dealing business and made real money again. Though
  you still dabble in questionable provenance and black market connections when profitable.
  Old habits die hard. When you heard about the investigation at the old **Montrose
  mansion**—where your ancestor Frankie did business in the 1920s—you couldn''t resist.
  Maybe the treasure is real. Maybe it''s here.'

  initial_quest: AO79
strategy: Your 🎨 Expert Art skill lets you read clues others can't—art authentication,
  provenance, artifact evaluation. Your 👥 Romano connection gives you access to clues
  about the Romano family that others can't read. But you won't be able to read everything.
  Find players whose skills complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're
  missing.
relationships:
  explorer: They've been hunting for the Romano treasure from the outside—maps, legends,
    historical records. You know the family from the inside. Neither of you has the
    full picture alone.
  mortician: Their family has been in this town as long as yours. The Romanos and
    the mortuary go back generations—your family kept them busy in the old days. They
    might have records that shed light on what happened to your family's assets.
  fixer: They've done legal work for your family for years. Recently they found something
    in old case files that got them excited enough to show up here. You want to know
    what it is.
