background: You're an **orphan**. You never knew your parents or where you truly came
  from. All you have is an **old diary**—worn, fragile, precious—that somehow ended
  up with you. The diary was written by someone named **Eleanor**. She writes about
  being adopted, about not knowing her real parents. She writes about searching for
  identity, for belonging. You don't know if **Eleanor** was your grandmother, great-grandmother,
  or some other relative. But her words speak to you across the generations. The diary
  contains a bread recipe—"my grandmother bread recipe," **Eleanor** calls it. You've
  been baking this bread your whole life and today you run "Sweet Rose Bakery", which
  has been featured on several popular food channels. Recently, you've started having
  **strange feelings**. Dreams. The face of a beautiful woman with a pearl necklace
  calling to you. A sense that you're connected to something bigger than yourself.
  When you heard about the investigation at the old **Montrose mansion**, something
  drew you here. You don't know why, but you feel like you need to be here.

strategy: Your 👥 Eleanor connection gives you access to personal clues that others
  can't read. Your 🔮 Basic Spiritual skill lets you access some vision clues, though
  your visions may be fragmented. But you won't be able to read everything. Find players
  whose skills complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  influencer: You're friends—they featured your bakery on their food channel. They've
    been researching Long Beach mysteries for years and they're curious about your
    rose bread recipe. You've never told anyone the full story of where it came from.
  fiduciary: They manage old family estates in Long Beach and they've been going through
    records for decades. If anyone has paperwork that could help you trace where you
    came from, it might be them.
  psychotherapist: They study how family trauma passes down through generations—even
    to people who never knew their family. You're an orphan who bakes a dead woman's
    bread recipe every day. They find that very interesting, and honestly, so do you.
