background: |-
  The Heiress commissioned you to restore and catalog the artwork in the **Montrose mansion**. Routine job. Old money, old paintings, old dust. You expected faded landscapes and stiff family portraits. Then you uncovered **her**. A portrait hidden behind a larger painting in the study—a young woman, mid-1920s, painted with extraordinary skill and unmistakable tenderness. The artist loved their subject. You could see it in every brushstroke. She was **hauntingly beautiful**. Dark eyes, a pearl necklace, an expression caught between joy and melancholy. You couldn't look away. You identified her as **Cordelia Rose Montrose**, born 1899, died 1925. She was only **26**. You started researching. And what you found consumed you. Cordelia was magnetic—the kind of woman who inspired devotion. Men wrote her poetry, wrote her music. You've cataloged every piece of art in the mansion now, but you keep coming back to Cordelia's portrait. You've studied her face so long you feel like you know her. The admirers, the tragedy, the mystery of her death at 26—it's all tangled together. When the investigation began, you didn't leave. You couldn't. Not until you understand who she really was and what happened to her.
