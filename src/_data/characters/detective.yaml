background: You've been investigating the **Montrose family** for months. On the surface,
  they're old Long Beach money—respectable, philanthropic, well-connected. But you've
  been pulling threads, and the fabric is rotting underneath. It started with a tip.
  An anonymous source pointed you toward irregularities in the **Montrose Family Trust**—payments
  that don't add up, assets that moved in suspicious ways, and a chain of inheritance
  that gets fuzzy the further back you go. Who actually owns the estate? The legal
  trail should be straightforward for a family this prominent, but it isn't. Then
  you started finding more. The Montroses have a pattern. When something threatens
  their reputation, it **disappears**. People. Records. Problems. You can't prove
  it yet. But you have fragments. When you heard about the investigation at the **Montrose
  mansion**—and that people from multiple connected families would be gathering in
  one place—you saw your opportunity. Old houses hold old evidence. And people with
  secrets tend to reveal them when they're surrounded by other people with secrets.
  You're here to build a case.

strategy: Your ⚖️ Expert Legal skill lets you read clues others can't—trust documents,
  financial records, estate papers. Your 📜 Basic History skill gives you some additional
  access to historical clues. But you won't be able to read everything. Find players
  whose skills complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  mortician: Their family has handled the dead in this town for a century. You're
    building a case that involves deaths from 1925. If anyone has private records
    about what really happened to those bodies, it's them.
  fiduciary: They manage the Montrose family estates and they've been going through
    old financial records for years. You've been investigating irregularities in those
    same estates. They have documents you need to see.
  journalist: You're both circling the Montrose family—they want a story, you want
    a case. Different goals, but the evidence trail is the same. Comparing notes could
    crack this thing open for both of you.
