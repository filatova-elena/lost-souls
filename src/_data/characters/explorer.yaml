background: |-
  You're a treasure hunter and explorer—some call you an archaeologist, others call you a scavenger. You prefer "historical recovery specialist." You chase legends, track down lost artifacts, and search for hidden wealth. You've been researching the Romano family for months. **Frankie "the Coast" Romano** controlled **bootlegging operations** at Long Beach harbor during Prohibition. The family made millions. Then the IRS seized everything in the 1960s-1980s. But the numbers don't add up. The IRS recovered less than the Romano family supposedly had. Where did the rest go? The legendary "**Romano Treasure**"—cash, contraband, valuable goods hidden before the government came knocking. Your research led you to the old **Montrose mansion**. Frankie did business here in the 1920s. You heard there was a connection to the Montroses. The property has been abandoned for decades. If the treasure exists, it could be hidden here.
