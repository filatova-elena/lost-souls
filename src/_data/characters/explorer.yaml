background: You're a treasure hunter and explorer—some call you an archaeologist,
  others call you a scavenger. You prefer "historical recovery specialist." You chase
  legends, track down lost artifacts, and search for hidden wealth. You've been researching
  the Romano family for months. **Frankie "the Coast" Romano** controlled **bootlegging
  operations** at Long Beach harbor during Prohibition. The family made millions.
  Then the IRS seized everything in the 1960s-1980s. But the numbers don't add up.
  The IRS recovered less than the Romano family supposedly had. Where did the rest
  go? The legendary "**Romano Treasure**"—cash, contraband, valuable goods hidden
  before the government came knocking. Your research led you to the old **Montrose
  mansion**. Frankie did business here in the 1920s. You heard there was a connection
  to the Montroses. The property has been abandoned for decades. If the treasure exists,
  it could be hidden here.

strategy: Your 📜 Expert History skill lets you read clues others can't—historical
  records, maps, and timelines. Your 🎨 Basic Art skill gives you some access to artifact
  and object clues. But you won't be able to read everything. Find players whose skills
  complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  artcollector: They're connected to the Romano family. You're hunting for the Romano
    treasure. They know the family history from the inside—you've been piecing it
    together from the outside. You need each other.
  professor: You're friends—they chase species, you chase legends. You've been all
    over the mansion grounds and you're finding things that need a scientist's eye
    to make sense of.
  fixer: They've handled legal work connected to the Romano family and they've seen
    the actual financial records from the IRS investigations. You've been hunting
    for what the IRS missed. Comparing notes could point you both in the right direction.
