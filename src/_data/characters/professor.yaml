background: 'You''re a botany professor, descended from **Professor Edmund Hartley**
  who ran a botanical garden and consultation service in 1920s Long Beach. You followed
  in his footsteps—plant toxicology, medicinal botany, historical uses of plants.
  Going through old family papers, you found Edmund''s consultation records from 1925.
  A "pharmaceutical professional" (anonymous) came to him asking about: **Digitalis
  purpurea (Foxglove)**—extraction methods, dosing; Damiana, Valerian, Mandrake—sourcing
  and preparation; How to mask bitter flavors in medicinal preparations. The notes
  also contain consultation records with **Harbor Import & Trading Co**. The specifics
  raise your suspicions about what exactly this company was and what your ancestor
  was involved in. You''ve been obsessed with this mystery ever since. When you heard
  about the investigation at the **Montrose mansion**, you had to come. You have a
  feeling it''s all connected.'

strategy: Your 🌿 Expert Botanical skill lets you read clues others can't—botanical
  specimens, plant identification, toxicology notes. Your 👥 Hartley connection gives
  you access to clues about Professor Hartley's consultations that others can't read.
  But you won't be able to read everything. Find players whose skills complement yours,
  and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  explorer: You're friends—they chase legends, you chase species. They've been all
    over the mansion grounds and might have found things they couldn't identify.
  clockmaker: They're obsessed with the timing of the 1925 events. You're obsessed
    with the plants. Different pieces of the same puzzle—what they know about when
    things happened might help you understand why certain ingredients were being sourced.
  herbalist: You study plants in textbooks, they study them in the dirt. Between their
    fieldwork and your research, you might piece together what he was really making.
