background: You run a small antiquarian shop, surrounded by other people's memories—old
  newspapers, estate sale finds, forgotten photographs, documents nobody wanted anymore.
  Every item is a piece of someone's story, and you can't bear to let those stories
  disappear. You've been here for decades, long enough to remember when this neighborhood
  felt like a village—when shopkeepers knew each other by name and Saturday mornings
  smelled like fresh bread from the bakery down the street. That bakery belonged to
  **David and Catherine Sullivan**, a family business famous for their **rose bread**—a
  recipe passed down through generations, originally created by **Eleanor Sullivan**.
  Catherine would bring you a loaf on Saturdays. David would stop by to chat about
  local history, curious about where the Sullivans came from. Then in **1990, a fire**
  took everything. The bakery, the family—gone. The official story was electrical
  failure, but you've spent a lifetime handling old things, and you know when something
  doesn't add up. Over the years, bits of the Sullivan story have kept finding their
  way to you—a clipping here, a photograph there. The past doesn't disappear, it just
  changes hands. When you heard about the investigation at the **Montrose mansion**,
  some of those pieces started to feel relevant. You don't have the full picture,
  but you had to come.

strategy: Your 📜 Basic History skill helps with research and local context. Your 🎨
  Basic Art skill lets you evaluate and date old objects. Your 👥 Eleanor connection
  gives you access to clues about the Sullivan family that others can't read. But
  you won't be able to read everything. Find players whose skills complement yours,
  and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  influencer: They've come into your shop over the years looking for material for
    their Long Beach mysteries series. They've been researching the Sullivan bakery
    fire—a story you know firsthand, not from clippings.
  baker: You've seen them around the neighborhood. There's something about them that
    tugs at you—something familiar you can't quite place. They bake bread that smells
    like Saturday mornings from thirty years ago.
  journalist: They cover local history for the paper and you've been a source for
    them before. You trust them to care about getting the story right. And the story
    of what happened to the Sullivan bakery deserves to be gotten right.
