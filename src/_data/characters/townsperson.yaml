background: You live a few blocks from the **Montrose mansion**. You've lived in this
  neighborhood your whole life. You've watched that old house sit empty for decades—weeds
  growing, windows dark, the kind of place kids dare each other to go near. You've
  heard the stories. Everyone has. Ghosts. Tragedies. The three deaths in **1925**.
  But you've also noticed things. The way the house seems to watch you back sometimes.
  The strange lights that appear in windows when nobody should be there. The way certain
  people avoid walking past it at night. You're not a detective. You're not a historian.
  You're just... curious. When you heard there was going to be some kind of investigation,
  an open house, people gathering to look into the mansion's secrets, you couldn't
  resist. You showed up and said "I'm just a curious neighbor" because that's the
  truth. You've been watching this place for years. You've noticed things. And now,
  finally, you might get some answers. Or at least, you'll be there when someone else
  finds them.

    family records.
  journalist: They're covering this story. They might have useful information about
    the investigation progress.
  influencer: They're documenting everything. Also, they love to talk. You might be
    able to get more information from them than you realize.
  antiquarian: You've been neighbors for years—their shop is just a few blocks away.
    They've been collecting local history and documents for decades. Ask them about
    what they've found related to the mansion or the families connected to it.
  mortician: Their family has run the mortuary in town for over 100 years. They know
    things about local deaths and history that most people don't. Ask them about the
    1925 deaths or any other suspicious deaths connected to the Montrose family.
  baker: A local baker who seems drawn to this place. You've probably seen them around
    town. Ask them what brought them here—their story might connect to things you've
    noticed.
