background: |-
  Your name is Whitmore. You've always known that. What you didn't always know was what it meant. You grew up with something you couldn't explain—flashes of insight, feelings that turned out to be true, a pull toward people's unspoken pain. Your family called it "being sensitive." You found tarot as a teenager, and it gave you a language for what you'd always felt. The cards didn't give you the gift—they gave you a way to **use** it. A few years ago, you started researching your family tree. The Whitmore name led you to Long Beach, to the 1920s, to a woman named **Alice Catherine Whitmore**. She had the same gift you do. Visions. Premonitions. The ability to sense what others couldn't. And they called her **hysterical**. Every doctor except one, Dr. Thaddeus Crane, wanted to put her in an institution. Officially, she fell down the stairs. Accidentally. You don't believe that for a second. A woman who knew things she shouldn't, sounds inconvenient. And you're here to prove that what happened to her wasn't an accident.

  main: main_quest

strategy: Your Expert Spiritual skill gives you full vision access and clear communication with spirits. Your Whitmore family knowledge gives you personal insight into Alice's life and abilities.
relationships:
  psychic: You share the spiritual gift, and you both have a connection to Alice—theirs through the Laveau family legacy, yours through blood.
  explorer: Their last name is Whitmore too. You noticed that immediately. Are they family? Do they know about Alice? There's a conversation waiting to happen.
  baker: You sense something in them—a sensitivity they don't fully understand. It feels familiar. Like recognizing your own gift in someone who doesn't have a name for it yet.
