background: 'You''re a psychotherapist specializing in **generational trauma**—the
  way pain, secrets, and unresolved grief pass down through families like invisible
  inheritance. You''ve published papers on how unspoken tragedies shape descendants
  who never even knew what happened. When you heard about the **Montrose mansion**
  investigation—three deaths in eleven days, a century of haunting, and multiple families
  still entangled in the aftermath—you knew this was the case study of a lifetime.
  You''ve been researching the families connected to the 1925 tragedy: the **Montroses**,
  the **Cranes**, the **Whitmores**, the **Monroes**, the **Hartleys**. The patterns
  are textbook. Name changes to escape shame. Obsessive preservation of artifacts.
  These people don''t just carry history—they''re **living** it. You came here to
  observe, to understand, to document. But the more you learn about these families,
  the more you realize: understanding the psychology might be the key to understanding
  the murders.'
objectives:
  main: main_quest
  private: major_secret_baby
strategy: Your 👥 connections to five different families (Montrose, Crane, Whitmore,
  Monroe, Hartley) give you access to clues about those families that others can't
  read. But you won't be able to read everything. Find players whose skills complement
  yours, and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  baker: An orphan who bakes the same bread recipe every day like a ritual. They don't
    know where they come from, but they showed up at this mansion like it was pulling
    them in. You've seen this before—people drawn to places connected to trauma they
    don't consciously remember.
  dressmaker: They've kept a dead woman's wedding dress preserved for a hundred years,
    passed down through their family like a holy relic. That's not sentimentality.
    That's unresolved grief with a heartbeat.
  portraitartist: They were hired to restore paintings and ended up unable to leave.
    They talk about Cordelia Montrose the way people talk about someone they've lost—not
    someone who died a century ago.
