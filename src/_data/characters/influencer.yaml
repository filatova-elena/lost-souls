personality: Content creator documenting everything. This mystery is perfect for your
  series—if you can debunk the supernatural.
skills:
- rumors_1
- history_2
- is_character_influencer
background: 'You run two popular series: "**Long Beach Urban Legends & Mysteries**"
  covering local history, unsolved cases, and supernatural claims (which you approach
  skeptically), and a food channel featuring the best local spots in Long Beach—from
  **Rosie''s Tamales** on 4th Street to **Sweet Rose Bakery** to the Vietnamese coffee
  shops on Anaheim. You''ve done mystery episodes on: The **Haunted Montrose Mansion**—ghostly
  sightings, rumors of tragedy; The Mysterious **Sullivan Bakery Fire**—suspicious
  1990s fire that destroyed a generations-old bakery; The **Romano Treasure** Legend—mob
  family wealth that supposedly escaped the IRS; Cursed Objects & Fatal Timing—featured
  your friend the Clockmaker and their mysterious pocket watch. Your latest research:
  **Three mysterious deaths in October 1925**. All at the same mansion. All within
  11 days. And nobody talks about it. When you heard about this investigation at the
  Montrose mansion, you knew you had to be here. You brought the Clockmaker (who''s
  obsessed with the timing). You''re friends with the Baker (featured Sweet Rose Bakery
  on your food channel). This is going to be your best episode yet.'

  main: main_quest
  private: minor_bakery_fire
strategy: Your 🗝️ Rumor skill gives you access to **rumor chests** hidden around the
  mansion—unlock them with the key attached to your character card. These contain
  gossip, tips, and leads that others can't access. Your 📜 Expert History skill lets
  you read historical clues others can't. But you won't be able to read everything.
  Find players whose skills complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're
  missing.
relationships:
  clockmaker: Your friend—you featured them and their mysterious pocket watch in your
    series. They think the universe runs on cosmic timing. You think that's a stretch.
    But they keep finding things that are hard to explain away.
  baker: You featured their bakery and their rose bread recipe on your food channel.
    Interesting story, you remember.
  antiquarian: They run an antique shop in the neighborhood and they've sold you old
    photographs and clippings over the years. They've been here longer than almost
    anyone and they remember things about this neighborhood that nobody else does.
