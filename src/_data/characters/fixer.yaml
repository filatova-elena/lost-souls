personality: Smooth operator who makes problems disappear. You found something in
  old case files that brought you here.
skills:
- legal_2
- personal_romano
- is_character_fixer
background: You're a fixer. Not officially, of course—on paper you're a lawyer specializing
  in "legacy estate resolution." But everyone in certain circles knows what that really
  means. When old money has old problems—sealed records, inconvenient documents, family
  skeletons rattling too loud—they call you. You make things clean. You make things
  quiet. You've handled work for the **Romano family** for years. Nothing dramatic—tidying
  up loose ends from the IRS seizures, managing claims against old assets, keeping
  certain documents from surfacing. Routine work. Until last month, when you were
  going through a box of sealed case files from the **1960s Romano investigations**.
  Buried in the paperwork, you found something that made your heart race. Financial
  discrepancies. The IRS recovered less than the Romano family supposedly had. Where
  did the rest go? You know what hidden wealth looks like. When you heard about the
  investigation at the **Montrose mansion**—where the Romanos did business in the
  1920s—you came to see what was buried. Because if there's one thing you've learned
  in this business, it's that old secrets have value. And this one could be worth
  millions.

strategy: Your ⚖️ Expert Legal skill lets you read clues others can't—contracts, financial
  records, estate papers. Your 👥 Romano connection gives you access to clues about
  the family that others can't read. But you won't be able to read everything. Find
  players whose skills complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  artcollector: They're Romano family. You've done work for them for years. Now you've
    both shown up at the same mansion chasing the same missing fortune—time to compare
    what you each know.
  explorer: They've been hunting the Romano treasure through historical research and
    legwork. You've been staring at the actual financial records. What the IRS seized
    and what was supposed to be there don't match—and they might know where to look
    for what's missing.
  detective: They investigate powerful families. You clean up after them. Different
    sides of the same business. They might have stumbled onto things in their Montrose
    investigation that connect to what you're looking for.
