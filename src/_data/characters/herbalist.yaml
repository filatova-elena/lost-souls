background: |-
  You're a herbalist—part folk healer, part forager, part plant whisperer. You make tinctures, salves, and remedies from things most people walk past without noticing. You believe plants hold memory, that gardens tell stories, that the earth remembers what humans try to forget. A few months ago, you were foraging near the old **Montrose mansion** when something caught your eye. In the overgrown grounds, you found the remnants of a **medicinal garden**. Not decorative—**functional**. Wormwood, rue, lavender. Then you found something that stopped you cold: **Damiana** (Turnera diffusa). A subtropical plant native to Baja Mexico. It has no business growing in a Long Beach garden. Someone planted it deliberately, in a sheltered south-facing bed where it could survive. When you heard about the investigation at the mansion, you knew this was your chance to get inside and find answers.
