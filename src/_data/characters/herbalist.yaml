background: 'You''re a herbalist—part folk healer, part forager, part plant whisperer.
  You make tinctures, salves, and remedies from things most people walk past without
  noticing. You believe plants hold memory, that gardens tell stories, that the earth
  remembers what humans try to forget. A few months ago, you were foraging near the
  old **Montrose mansion** when something caught your eye. In the overgrown grounds,
  you found the remnants of a **medicinal garden**. Not decorative—**functional**.
  Wormwood, rue, lavender. Then you found something that stopped you cold: **Damiana**
  (Turnera diffusa). A subtropical plant native to Baja Mexico. It has no business
  growing in a Long Beach garden. Someone planted it deliberately, in a sheltered
  south-facing bed where it could survive. When you heard about the investigation
  at the mansion, you knew this was your chance to get inside and find answers.'

strategy: Your 🌿 Expert Botanical skill lets you read clues others can't—botanical
  specimens, plant identification, garden notes. Your 🔮 Basic Spiritual skill gives
  you some access to vision clues. But you won't be able to read everything. Find
  players whose skills complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  professor: You study plants in the dirt, they study them in textbooks. You're both
    trying to understand the same garden—but they have the academic context and you
    have the hands-on instinct.
  psychic: They sense things through spirits the way you sense things through plants—memory
    stored in living things. You found something growing on these grounds that shouldn't
    be here. They might understand why it's still alive.
  astrologer: They see Sebastian's work through celestial alchemy—star charts and
    sacred timing. You see it through the soil—what he planted, what he cultivated.
    Different languages for the same mystery.
