background: 'Your name is **Margo Laveau**, and you carry one of the most famous names
  in spiritualism. Your great-great-grandmother was **Célestine Laveau**, world-renowned
  French psychic who came to California during the spiritualism boom of the 1920s.
  In 1925, a young woman named **Alice Whitmore** came to Célestine seeking help.
  Alice had psychic abilities herself—visions, premonitions, knowledge of things she
  shouldn''t know. She was frightened, misunderstood by doctors who called her unstable.
  Célestine recognized Alice''s genuine gift and tried to mentor her. Then Alice died.
  **October 7, 1925**. Officially ruled an accident. But Alice''s spirit reached out
  to Célestine immediately. She was trapped, restless, murdered. She needed help.
  Célestine tried to give her peace, tried to help her move on, but Alice''s spirit
  remained bound to the place she died—the **Montrose mansion**. For **100 years**,
  Alice has been waiting. Calling out to the Laveau family. Generation after generation
  heard her plea but couldn''t break through, couldn''t help her find peace. You grew
  up hearing about "the restless spirit in Long Beach." The unfinished business. The
  young woman who died trying to save her friend. Your family''s failure to help her.
  When the Heiress contacted you about the haunted mansion, you knew immediately:
  this is Alice. After a century, the time is finally right. You''re here to finish
  what Célestine started.'

  main: main_quest
  private: minor_alice_second_sight
  initial_quest: AO81
strategy: Your 🔮 Expert Spiritual skill gives you access to **vision clues**—spiritual
  messages and ghostly communications that others can't access. Your 👥 Whitmore connection
  gives you access to clues about Alice Whitmore that others can't read. But you won't
  be able to read everything. Find players whose skills complement yours, and trade
  what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  heiress: They hired you to deal with the haunting and they've been living with these
    spirits for months. Whatever the ghosts have been trying to say, the Heiress has
    been hearing it longer than anyone.
  dressmaker: You sense the dead clinging to the living, and this one carries more
    than they realize.
  herbalist: They believe plants hold memory the way you believe spirits do. But they
    can read the garden and you can read the ghosts. You suspect you're both looking
    at different sides of the same story.
