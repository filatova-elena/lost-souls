personality: Wealthy, dramatic socialite who lives in the haunted mansion. Terrified

background: 'You''re a distant relative of the **Montrose family**—the mansion came
  to you through a complicated inheritance chain. Your family isn''t particularly
  close; you barely knew about this Long Beach property until the Fiduciary tracked
  you down and informed you that you''d inherited it. At first, you were thrilled.
  A mansion! Your own place! Independence from your annoying family! You moved in
  immediately, thinking it would be a glamorous fresh start. Then you realized: it''s
  **haunted**. Very **haunted**. Doors open by themselves. You hear footsteps. Cold
  spots in certain rooms. Sometimes you see figures in **1920s clothing**. One room
  in particular—you refuse to go in there anymore. Something terrible happened in
  that room. You''re scared, but also too proud to admit you made a mistake and move
  back. So you hired **Margo Laveau**, the psychic medium, to "deal with it." Now
  all these people have shown up to investigate. Part of you is relieved (safety in
  numbers), part of you is annoyed (this is YOUR house), and part of you is terrified
  of what they might discover. What happened in your mansion **100 years ago**? And
  why won''t the **ghosts** leave you alone?'
objectives:
  main: main_quest
  private: major_secret_baby
  initial_quest: AO116
strategy: Your 🗝️ Rumor skill gives you access to **rumor chests** hidden around the
  mansion—unlock them with the key attached to your character card. Your 👥 Montrose
  connection gives you access to clues about the family that others can't read. But
  you won't be able to read everything. Find players whose skills complement yours,
  and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  psychic: You hired them to deal with the ghosts. Whatever the spirits haunting your
    mansion have been trying to say, you've been hearing it for months. Maybe they
    can finally translate.
  mortician: They're unnervingly calm about everything, which you find both irritating
    and oddly reassuring. They seem to know a lot about old death records—and you're
    starting to think the deaths in your mansion's past are the key to everything.
  portraitartist: You hired them to restore the paintings. They've been working in
    the mansion for weeks now and they've become slightly obsessed with one portrait
    in particular. You want to know what they've found—it's your house, after all.
