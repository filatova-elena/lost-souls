  Your family name is **Sinclair**, but it wasn't always.

You knew you descended from **Dr. Thaddeus Crane**, a respectable town doctor from the 1920s. That's ALL you knew—the family buried everything else. Recently, you made a shocking discovery: **Dr. Thaddeus Crane** had a brother you've never heard about! When you heard about the investigation at the **Montrose mansion**, you knew you had to come. You have a feeling it's all connected.
