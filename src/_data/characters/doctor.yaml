background: 'Your family name is **Sinclair**, but it wasn''t always. You eventually
  discovered that your family changed their name in the 1960s for political reasons—your
  ancestors were the **Crane family** of Long Beach. You knew you descended from **Dr.
  Thaddeus Crane**, a respectable town doctor from the 1920s. That''s ALL you knew—the
  family buried everything else. Recently, you made a shocking discovery: **Dr. Thaddeus
  Crane** had a brother you''ve never heard about! When you heard about the investigation
  at the **Montrose mansion**, you knew you had to come. You have a feeling it''s
  all connected.'

strategy: Your ⚕️ Expert Medical skill lets you read clues others can't—pharmaceutical
  formulas, death certificates, medical records. Your 👥 Crane connection gives you
  access to clues about the Crane family that others can't read. But you won't be
  able to read everything. Find players whose skills complement yours, and trade what
  you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  fiduciary: They sent you a box of old papers that turned your family history upside
    down. They know more about your family's estate records than you do—and you have
    questions.
  mortician: Their family has handled deaths in this town for over a century. You're
    a doctor investigating deaths from 1925. They deal with the same bodies from the
    other side of the table.
  astrologer: They've been researching someone connected to your family—someone you've
    only recently learned existed. They seem to admire this person. You're not sure
    how you feel about that yet.
