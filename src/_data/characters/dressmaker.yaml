background: 'You''re descended from **Elias Monroe**, the dressmaker who created **Cordelia
  Montrose**''s **wedding dress** in 1925. The dress that was **never worn**. The
  bride who never made it to the altar. Your family has preserved everything from
  Elias''s workshop—his tools, his sketches, his correspondence. But most importantly:
  the dress itself. **White silk**, delicate lace, perfect in every detail. A masterpiece
  that was **never worn**. Elias was in love with Cordelia. Everyone in your family
  knows this story. He sent her flowers, wrote her poems, and begged her not to marry
  **Sebastian Crane**. Yes, not everyone knows who Cordelia was engaged to. Few people
  even remember that name: **Sebastian Crane**. It''s as if he was erased from history.
  But you grew up with this story. You grew up with the dress. You can''t stop thinking
  about Cordelia—the romantic, tragic bride. You preserve her dress like a shrine.
  You research her life, her death, what could have been. Some people say your fixation
  is unhealthy. Maybe they''re right. But you need to know the truth. What happened
  to Cordelia? Why did she die?'

strategy: Your 👥 Montrose and Monroe connections give you access to clues about Cordelia
  Montrose and Elias Monroe that others can't read. Your 🔮 Basic Spiritual skill gives
  you some access to vision clues. But you won't be able to read everything. Find
  players whose skills complement yours, and trade what you know for what you're missing.
relationships:
  psychic: If anyone in this mansion can reach Cordelia's spirit, it's them. You've
    spent your whole life preserving her memory through objects. They might be able
    to reach her directly.
  heiress: They live in the Montrose mansion—the place where your ancestor knew Cordelia.
    The house is full of a century's worth of belongings, and some of them might connect
    to the story you've been carrying your whole life.
  portraitartist: You're both drawn to Cordelia, but from different angles—you through
    what your family passed down, they through something they found in the mansion.
    Comparing what you each know might reveal more than either of you has alone.
