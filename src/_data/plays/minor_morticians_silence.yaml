          [SILAS BLACKWELL had been a mortician for fifteen years, since returning from the War with hands too steady and a mind too comfortable with death to do anything else.]

          SILAS: October 1925 was different. Three bodies arrived at my mortuary within eleven days. All young. All from the same estate. All suspicious.

          [SILAS unwraps the sheet covering ALICE MARGARET WHITMORE, age 22.]

          SILAS: Beautiful, peaceful in death—except for the crushed wound at the back of her skull.

          [He takes meticulous notes.]

          SILAS (writing): Blunt force trauma, no signs of struggle. Injury pattern inconsistent with accidental fall. Trauma angle suggests horizontal strike from behind. Fingernails perfect, unbroken. No defensive marks.

          [SILAS examines SEBASTIAN MONTGOMERY CRANE, age 30.]

          SILAS (writing): October 11, 1925. Acute poisoning. Cardiac tissue blackened, deteriorated. Liver mottled, purpled, necrotic. Stomach lining shows chemical burns. The damage extensive and unmistakable.

          [SILAS examines CORDELIA ROSE MONTROSE, age 26.]

          SILAS (writing): October 18, 1925. Signs of systemic poisoning. Kidneys scarred. Stomach lining shows mild irritation. Cherry-colored staining around mouth and teeth from something sweet-smelling, organic, herbal. Mixed with honey. Cumulative toxin exposure over weeks.

          [A MESSENGER appears in the doorway—well-dressed, unfamiliar.]

          MESSENGER: Letter for Mr. Blackwell.

          SILAS: From?

          MESSENGER: No return address, sir.

          [The MESSENGER sets the envelope on the desk and leaves quickly. SILAS opens it slowly. Inside is a single card with a brief note in elegant script: "For your discretion." Beneath it, folded carefully, is a five-hundred-dollar bill.]

          SILAS: Five hundred dollars. Cash payment. No identification. More than most morticians made in three months. Who would pay this much to keep quiet?

          [SILAS picks up his pen and writes the official death certificates.]

          SILAS (writing): Alice Margaret Whitmore - Cause of Death: Accidental fall. Sebastian Montgomery Crane - Cause of Death: Accidental poisoning (suspected self-administered). Cordelia Rose Montrose - Cause of Death: Heart failure.

          [He seals each certificate carefully, his hands steady, his conscience quieter than perhaps it should have been. But SILAS is a careful man. He keeps his own private notes—the real observations, the discrepancies, the truth he'd documented before the money arrived.]

        title: "The Heart Stops"
        location: "Dr. Thaddeus Crane's Office, October 11, 1925"

        content: |
          [THADDEUS signs the death certificates as the attending physician.]

          THADDEUS (writing): October 11, 1925. Alice Whitmore. Cause of death: Accidental fall. I signed the certificate. No one will question it. She was "unstable." She had "episodes." A tragic accident.

  act_iii:
    name: "Act III: The Investigation"
    purpose: "Build the case - examine discrepancies, identify who had motive and means"

        content: |
          [THE INVESTIGATOR compares SILAS's private notes with the official death certificates.]

          THE INVESTIGATOR: Silas documented the truth: Alice was murdered, not an accidental fall. Sebastian was poisoned, not accidental. Cordelia died from chronic poisoning, not natural heart failure. But the official certificates say something completely different.

      - scene: 2

          [THE INVESTIGATOR examines the payment records.]

          THE INVESTIGATOR: Five hundred dollars. Anonymous payment. October 1925. Just after the three bodies arrived. Someone paid Silas to keep quiet. But who?

      - scene: 3
        title: "The Signatures"

        characters:
          - THE INVESTIGATOR

          [THE INVESTIGATOR examines the death certificates.]

          THE INVESTIGATOR: All three death certificates were signed by the same person: Dr. Thaddeus Crane, the attending physician. He had everything to lose if the truth came out. He had motive. He had means. He had opportunity.

          [THADDEUS signs Cordelia's death certificate.]

          THADDEUS (writing): October 18, 1925. Cordelia Montrose. Cause of death: Heart failure. Natural causes. No one will question it. She was already fragile. She died of a broken heart, devastated by Sebastian's death. That's what everyone will believe.

  act_iv:
    name: "Act IV: The Revelation"
    purpose: "Reveal that Thaddeus paid Silas to cover up the truth"

        title: "The Truth"
        location: "The Investigation Room"

          - SILAS BLACKWELL (voice or memory)
        content: |
          [THE INVESTIGATOR pieces together the complete story.]

          THE INVESTIGATOR: Dr. Thaddeus Crane paid Silas Blackwell $500 cash to falsify the death certificates and keep quiet about discrepancies.

          Silas discovered: Alice was murdered (not an accidental fall), Sebastian was poisoned (not accidental), Cordelia died from chronic poisoning (not natural heart failure). He took the money but kept private notes.

          SILAS (voice): I thought it must be the Montroses. But the payment wasn't from the Montrose family. It was from Dr. Thaddeus Crane—the physician who signed all three death certificates.

          THE INVESTIGATOR: Thaddeus murdered Alice on October 10 with a silver candle holder. He poisoned his own brother Sebastian. He slowly poisoned Cordelia for 44 days. He paid Silas $500 at Blackwell & Sons Mortuary to make sure the official record would never reflect what the bodies revealed.

        title: "The Regret"
        location: "Blackwell & Sons Mortuary"
        characters:
          - SILAS BLACKWELL
        content: |
          [SILAS reflects on his decision.]

          SILAS: I took the money. I wrote the false certificates. But I kept my private notes. The truth. The discrepancies. The real observations. Perhaps someday someone would find them. Perhaps someday the truth would come out.

          I am a careful man. I document everything. Even the things I'm paid to forget.

          [Silas's silence was bought, but his notes preserved the truth. The mortician's silence was not complete. The truth remained, waiting to be discovered.]
