          A letter arrives, embossed with the seal of a generational wealth management firm.

          THE FIDUCIARY (V.O.)
          Miss Montrose, we are writing to inform you that you are the heir to the Montrose family estate in Long Beach, California. The property has been held in trust for several decades, and our records indicate you are the closest living relative with a legal claim...

          THE HEIRESS reads the letter, her face lighting up with opportunity.

          THE HEIRESS
          A mansion of my own? In Long Beach? How glamorous. How perfect.

          She moves in, expecting elegance and independence. But she discovers she is not alone.

          Cordelia? Cordelia, where are you?

          SEBASTIAN (in the laboratory, examining a bottle)
          The Elixir of Eternal Love... my Great Work... it was meant to bind us forever.

          CORDELIA (at the piano, playing a haunting melody)
          [plays a haunting melody, lost in thought]

          THE HEIRESS (whispering)

          SEBASTIAN (writing)
          March 15, 1920. What is love but chemistry? The ancients understood this—Venus and desire, the movement of blood, the quickening of the heart. Can we understand the mechanism? Strengthen it? The formula must work on two levels: the physical and the eternal.

          [Sketch: circular diagram showing heart radiating outward with botanical symbols around the perimeter]

          DR. THADDEUS CRANE sits in his office on Ocean Avenue. Two difficult diagnoses—pernicious anemia and quinsy—both handled with precision. His white coat is immaculate. The framed diploma from Johns Hopkins hangs on the wall.

          He opens his personal journal and writes:

          THADDEUS (writing)
          On Dr. Morrison and Lesser Minds

          The Morrison clinic is insufferable. Dr. Morrison approaches medicine as if it were mere carpentry—measuring, testing, building without vision. Medicine is art. It requires the kind of intellectual superiority that separates the truly great physicians from the merely adequate.

          On Patients and Belief

          I prescribed a new tonic for Mrs. Harrington today. She will attribute any improvement to my brilliance. Of course, the improvement comes from her own body's natural healing—but she will never understand this. People need to believe in their doctor. They need to feel their fate rests in superior hands. It is kinder this way.

          All these years of theoretical work—this MEANS something.

          I spoke to Hartley at the university. He confirmed my ingredients are sound. I know what I must do. The ginseng root is the answer—the binding agent. Small pinch only. Enough to SUGGEST eternity.

          INT. LONG BEACH SPEAKEASY - NIGHT

          A warm September evening. The air is thick with jazz music, cigarette smoke, and the sharp tang of bootleg gin.

          SEBASTIAN CRANE stands in the corner, dark eyes surveying the crowd with amusement. He'd always been the black sheep of the Crane family. His brother Thaddeus was the golden child—the physician, beloved by Long Beach society. Sebastian, on the other hand, had spent his childhood setting small fires during chemistry experiments and mixing volatile compounds in his father's shed.

          Now he was a pharmacist by day, chemist by nature, and opportunist by necessity. Prohibition had been a gift to men like him. Through his connection with Frankie Romano at the port, Sebastian supplied half the speakeasies in Long Beach with grain alcohol—all perfectly legal, of course. Medical supplies. Medicinal tonics. The paperwork was impeccable. Among certain circles, he'd earned a reputation: they called him The Alchemist.

          He watched the crowd with detached interest. Respectable people pretending to be dangerous, their laughter a touch too loud, their movements a touch too reckless. Playing at rebellion.

          Then he heard laughter to his right—bright and unrestrained.

          He turned.

          The woman had large brown eyes that caught the low lamplight, sparkling with mischief. High society, certainly—he could tell by the cut of her dress, the way she held herself. But there was something untamed about her, something that didn't quite fit the polished surface. When she laughed, she wasn't pretending.

          Their eyes met across the hazy room.

          She smiled at him—not coy, not calculated. Just smiled, as if she'd found something surprising and delightful.

          SEBASTIAN couldn't look away.

          CORDELIA (writing)
          September 21, 1924. He came to the garden this afternoon. Sebastian Crane. I've heard of him—the apothecary with the reputation for eccentricity. But seeing him is different than hearing about him. There's something in his eyes. A kind of wonder, as if he's looking at the world and seeing poetry where others see only facts.

          He asked me about the roses. Not their names or their botanical properties, but what I felt when I looked at them. No one has asked me that in years.

          Thomas used to ask me questions like that.

          I spent years working on a formula I knew nothing about. Thought I could capture LOVE in liquid form. I, a man who once mixed the wrong ratio of potassium bromide and nearly went blind, could be trusted with Cordelia's wellbeing.

          I tested on myself—me, the least qualified person to test anything. Should have consulted more with Hartley. Should have been more careful.

          And now Cordelia is dying because I was careless. Because I was arrogant.

          I gave her poison thinking it was poetry.

          But how is that possible? The elixir was supposed to be perfect. He worked on it for years. Every ingredient was supposed to be harmless.

          He looked at me with such guilt in his eyes. As if he believed he had poisoned me.

          I told him it wasn't his fault. That whatever this is, we will face it together. But even as I said it, I felt the lie in my words. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong.

          I couldn't stay silent. Not with Alice at risk. So I went to him. To Thaddeus. I told him to end it immediately, or I would expose his affair to the entire medical board, to all of Long Beach society. I told him I would destroy his reputation if he didn't leave her alone.

          October 10, 1925. Cordelia discovered my affair with Alice. She threatened to expose me. I had only one way out: eliminate Cordelia.

          I examined Sebastian's Elixir of Eternal Love formula—it was harmless. I secretly added concentrated foxglove extract, making it deadly.

          September 4, 1925, 6:14 AM. Sebastian administered the first dose to Cordelia during the Jupiter-Venus conjunction. He had no idea I had corrupted the formula.

          Every morning, Sebastian added the poisoned elixir to Cordelia's tea. Symptoms: weakness, nausea, confusion, cardiac irregularities. The poison accumulated over 44 days.

          October 7, 1925. Sebastian tested the elixir on himself. Within hours, he was violently ill.

          I realized: I've murdered my own brother. Sebastian was never supposed to taste the elixir.

          I frantically searched for an antidote, but foxglove is unforgiving. I couldn't save him.

          October 10, 1925. I went to Alice. I told her everything. She urged me to confess. But I realized Alice wouldn't back down.

          Desperate, I murdered Alice Whitmore to silence her. I used a silver candle holder. I staged it to look like an accidental fall.

          Sebastian died October 11, 1925, 03:00. Cordelia died October 18, 1925, 06:45.

          I signed all three death certificates as the attending physician. I sent $500 cash anonymously to Silas Blackwell at Blackwell & Sons Mortuary to keep quiet about discrepancies.

          I am a monster.

          ALICE
          Thaddeus... he killed me? The man I loved?

          SEBASTIAN
          My own brother... he corrupted my work. I was innocent all along.

          CORDELIA
          Thaddeus... because I threatened to expose his affair with Alice.

          THE HEIRESS
          The truth has been buried for a century. But now it's free.

          The ghosts begin to fade, finding peace at last.

          ALICE
          We can finally rest.

          SEBASTIAN
          The truth is known.

          CORDELIA
          Justice, at last.

          The three ghosts disappear, their souls finally at peace.
