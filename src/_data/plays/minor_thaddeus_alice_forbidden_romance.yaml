          [ALICE WHITMORE came to DR. THADDEUS CRANE in 1924 because other doctors wanted to institutionalize her.]

          ALICE: They call me "unstable," "hysterical," say my visions are delusions. My family is concerned—I've been having episodes since my brother Thomas died at sea. Nightmares. Fits of distress. Visions that terrify me.

          [But DR. THADDEUS believed her. He recognized Alice was truly psychic—not insane, just sensitive to truths others couldn't perceive.]

          THADDEUS: I think what you're experiencing is extraordinary. You are certainly not mad, Alice.

          THADDEUS: I think that what you're experiencing is extraordinary. You are certainly not mad, Alice.

          [Something shifted in his chest at that moment—professional detachment giving way to something more dangerous. Her eyes shone with an intelligence that recognized intelligence in himself.]

          ALICE: You believe me. You actually believe me.

          THADDEUS: I believe in you.

          THADDEUS (writing): July 2, 1924. There was an electric contact between us today. When I touched her hand, I felt something I shouldn't have felt. She is my patient. This is forbidden. But I cannot help myself.

          [CORDELIA MONTROSE sees them together in the Whitmore garden. Walking arm in arm, very close.]

          CORDELIA: Thaddeus! Alice! This is... this is completely inappropriate. A doctor and his patient—it violates every ethical boundary.

          THADDEUS: How very protective of you, Cordelia. How very noble.

          [But the threat is real. Everything he'd built—his reputation, his practice, his social standing—could be destroyed by one scandal.]

          THADDEUS: I can't, Alice. I can't lose everything I've built.

          ALICE: Then I'll expose you. I can't stay silent about this.

          [The forbidden romance between Dr. Thaddeus Crane and Alice Whitmore was the catalyst for everything. It led to three deaths. It destroyed everything it touched. Love corrupted by secrecy, by fear, by the need to protect a reputation at any cost.]
