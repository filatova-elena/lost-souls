          [SEBASTIAN MONTGOMERY CRANE was the black sheep of the Crane family. His brother Thaddeus was the golden child—the physician beloved by Long Beach society.]

          NARRATOR: Sebastian had spent his childhood setting small fires during chemistry experiments and mixing volatile compounds in his father's shed. His parents had been equal parts proud and exasperated.

          By day: respectable pharmacist. Clean-cut, well-spoken, engaged to a Montrose.

          By night: "The Alchemist"—one of Frankie Romano's most valuable assets in the bootlegging operation.

          [SEBASTIAN works in his laboratory, surrounded by glass bottles and botanical specimens.]

          SEBASTIAN: Prohibition has been a gift to men like me. Through my connection with Frankie Romano at the port, I supply half the speakeasies in Long Beach with grain alcohol—all perfectly legal, of course. Medical supplies. Medicinal tonics. The paperwork is impeccable.

          I create high-quality bootleg spirits disguised as pharmaceutical preparations. Legal cover, illegal profits. I am "The Alchemist"—a man who can transmute legality into fortune, who understands that the right chemistry can transform anything—prohibition into profit, powder into potion, law into opportunity.

          FRANKIE: Sebastian, you're one of my most valuable assets. Your pharmaceutical expertise makes you invaluable. You know chemistry. You know plants. You know how to make things taste good and work better.

          SEBASTIAN: The operation has been wildly successful. I've made a significant fortune. I've purchased a house on Ocean Boulevard. I no longer need to get my hands dirty.

          THE INVESTIGATOR: Exotic goods. Rare botanical specimens. Grain alcohol. All documented as "medical supplies" and "medicinal tonics." The paperwork is impeccable. But what's really being shipped?

          [When SEBASTIAN began courting CORDELIA MONTROSE, her family was initially disapproving.]

          MARGARET (voice): A pharmacist? Pursuing a Montrose? But once we learned about his not insignificant fortune (of somewhat dubious origins, perhaps, but quite substantial nonetheless), we stopped asking questions.

          THE INVESTIGATOR: Grain alcohol. 95% proof. Labeled as "medical supplies." But it's really bootleg spirits, disguised as pharmaceutical preparations. Sebastian's genius: legal cover, illegal profits.

          [The argument is public. Loud. Dock workers turn to look.]

          FRANKIE: You're making a mistake, Sebastian. A big mistake.

          [When Sebastian died days later, everyone assumed Frankie did it. But Frankie didn't kill Sebastian.]

          - THE INVESTIGATOR
        content: |
          [THE INVESTIGATOR pieces together the complete story.]

          THE INVESTIGATOR: Sebastian Crane was known as "The Alchemist" and he was one of Frankie Romano's most valuable assets in the bootlegging operation at the Harbor Import & Trading Co. He created and sold high-quality bootleg spirits disguised as medicinal tonics.

          By day, he was a respectable pharmacist, engaged to Cordelia Montrose. By night, he was "The Alchemist"—a man who could transmute legality into fortune, who understood that the right chemistry could transform anything—prohibition into profit, powder into potion, law into opportunity.

          The operation had been wildly successful. Sebastian had made a significant fortune. He purchased a house on Ocean Boulevard. He no longer needed to get his hands dirty.

          When he got engaged to Cordelia, he wanted out of the operation. He approached Frankie at the docks, certain the man would accept it eventually. But Frankie was furious. The argument was public. Loud.

          When Sebastian died shortly after, everyone assumed Frankie did it. But Frankie didn't kill Sebastian. The real killer was much closer to home.

        content: |
          [SEBASTIAN's ghost reflects on his dual identity.]

          SEBASTIAN (ghost): I was "The Alchemist." I supplied half the speakeasies in Long Beach with bootleg spirits. I made a fortune. I thought I could walk away. I thought I could leave the criminal life behind.

          But I couldn't. Not really. The past always catches up with you. The secrets always come out.

          [Sebastian's dual identity—respectable pharmacist by day, bootlegger by night—was his secret. But secrets have a way of being discovered. And in the end, it wasn't his criminal past that killed him. It was his own brother.]
