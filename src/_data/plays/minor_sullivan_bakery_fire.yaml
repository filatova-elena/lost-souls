          [Sullivan's Bakery, a Long Beach institution for over sixty years, was famous for the family's rose bread recipe passed down through generations.]

          NARRATOR: Founded by Eleanor Sullivan in the 1940s, the bakery had been a beloved part of the community. The rose bread recipe—Cordelia Montrose's favorite—was the family's legacy, passed from mother to daughter, generation to generation.

          NARRATOR: The fire spread with unusual rapidity, consuming the building before firefighters could respond.

          FIRE MARSHAL CHEN (voice): The fire spread with unusual rapidity. The preliminary finding is electrical wiring failure. Case closed. Tragic accident.

          [But responding firefighters noted accelerant patterns. The blaze spread too fast, too hot, too completely. One neighbor reported seeing an unidentified figure fleeing the building in the darkness, just before the flames erupted.]

          [The victims: David Sullivan, age 38, owner of the bakery. Catherine Sullivan, age 36, his wife. Both found dead in the ruins.]

          NARRATOR: Reports stated the Sullivans had an infant child, though no body was recovered despite extensive searches of the charred remains.

        content: |
          [When THE BAKER was left as an infant, an orphan, on the concrete steps of St. Mary Medical Center, they had only one thing: a worn leather journal belonging to someone named Eleanor.]

          NARRATOR: The journal contained a faded black-and-white photograph of a striking young woman with large brown eyes and long dark hair, standing in a garden surrounded by roses. And two recipes for rose bread: one old, fading, handwritten, and one new, written in a neat, precise hand.

          No note. No explanation. Just the journal, the photograph, and the recipe.

          [THE INVESTIGATOR examines the timing of the fire.]

          THE INVESTIGATOR: The fire occurred just as new interest in the 1925 Montrose mystery had surfaced. Investigations were being reopened. Old documents were being examined. The Sullivan family had operated the bakery continuously since 1927, founded by Eleanor Sullivan—a name that appeared in those historical records.

          [In March 1991, THOMAS REED, age 69, was arrested on multiple charges including property destruction.]

          NARRATOR: He was living under an assumed name, refused to cooperate with questioning, and his associates remained unknown. The investigation never fully officially connected him to the Sullivan fire.

          [THE FIDUCIARY examines trust records.]

          THE FIDUCIARY: The records mention Eleanor Sullivan as the illegitimate daughter of Cordelia Montrose. But the adoption was never legally finalized. On paper, Eleanor Sullivan remained Cordelia Montrose's legitimate biological heir. And every descendant after her inherited that legal status.

          THE INVESTIGATOR: So the Sullivans were the true heirs to the Montrose fortune?

          THE FIDUCIARY: Yes. That's why they were targeted.

          THE INVESTIGATOR: October 1990. The Montrose family paid Thomas Reed $10,500. Just before the November fire. This is no coincidence.

          [THOMAS REED arrives at the bakery after closing, in the dead of night.]

          CATHERINE: Who are you? What do you want?

          THOMAS: I'm here to eliminate the true heirs. The Montrose family wants you gone.

          [CATHERINE realizes what's happening. She's holding her baby, and in that moment of terror, she makes a desperate plea.]

          CATHERINE: Please, not my baby!

          [While pleading, while distracting the arsonist, she does something else—something that would matter more than her own life. She secretly tucks an old diary under the baby's blankets. Her last act. Her final gift.]

          [THOMAS REED sets the fire, but he can't kill the baby. He grabs the infant carrier, oblivious to the diary wedged deep between the quilted padding and the plastic shell. He leaves the bundle on the concrete steps of St. Mary Medical Center, disappearing into the salt-thick Long Beach night.]

          [THE INVESTIGATOR pieces together the motive.]

          THE INVESTIGATOR: The Montrose family hired Thomas Reed, age 69, to eliminate the Sullivan family. The reason: the Sullivans were the true heirs to the Montrose fortune.

          Eleanor Sullivan was Cordelia Montrose's secret baby. The adoption was never legally finalized. Eleanor and all her descendants remained the legitimate biological heirs to the Montrose estate at Montrose Mansion.

          The Montrose family paid Thomas Reed $10,500 in October 1990, just before the November fire. They hired an arsonist to eliminate the true heirs.

          [THE INVESTIGATOR reveals the complete truth.]

          THE INVESTIGATOR: The Montrose family hired an arsonist to eliminate the Sullivan family, who ran the bakery. The Sullivans were the true heirs to the Montrose fortune through Eleanor Sullivan, Cordelia Montrose's secret baby.

          The arsonist, Thomas Reed, 69, came in the darkness, murdered David and Catherine Sullivan, set the fire, and fled. But he couldn't kill the baby.

          Catherine Sullivan, the Baker's mother, realized what was happening. She was holding her baby, and in that moment of terror, she made a desperate plea: "Please, not my baby!"

          While pleading, while distracting the arsonist, she did something else—something that would matter more than her own life. She secretly tucked an old diary under the baby's blankets. Her last act. Her final gift.

          Thomas Reed set the fire, but he couldn't kill the baby. He grabbed the infant carrier, oblivious to the diary wedged deep between the quilted padding and the plastic shell. He left the bundle on the concrete steps of St. Mary Medical Center, disappearing into the salt-thick Long Beach night.

          Unknowingly, he left behind the diary—Catherine's final gift to her child, a voice from the past that would one day tell them exactly who they were.

        content: |
          [The baby was the sole surviving member of the Sullivan family.]

          NARRATOR: The fire had consumed everything else—the bakery, the family, the documents. All that endured was a small, cloth-bound diary, its cover bearing no name, its pages holding nothing but a handful of mysterious photographs of a beautiful woman in a rose garden, her dress and bobbed hair unmistakably of the 1920s, and a single handwritten recipe for rose bread.

          With no title on the binding and no signature within, the book offered no clues to the child's identity, leaving the Sullivan legacy to be swallowed by the ash—and but for a single recipe, which holds the key to the past.

          [The Baker, the sole survivor, carries the legacy forward. The recipe, the photographs, the diary—all that remains of the Sullivan family, all that connects them to their true heritage.]
