  Elias Monroe was a dressmaker with an artist's eye and a romantic's heart. The day Cordelia Montrose walked into his shop, he fell in love.

  He sent her flowers, wrote her poems, made her dresses that would make other women weep with envy. Each stitch was a declaration of devotion she never seemed to see. She smiled at him kindly, but her eyes never lingered.

  Then she disappeared for months in early 1925. When she returned, the lightness had gone out of her. She carried something heavy, something unspeakable.

  Then came Sebastian Crane—dark-mysterious, charming, yet stable, not like her first love Thomas Whitmore. Cordelia fell like a moth to flame. Elias tried to tell her that Sebastian was not the man for her, that he was too dangerous, but she dismissed him.

  So he made her wedding dress instead. White silk and lace, every stitch a prayer. He tucked a lock of her hair into the hem—a secret goodbye.

  By September, she looked pale, thin, trembling.

  In her final moments, Cordelia called for Elias. She gave him a handwritten rose bread recipe and entrusted him to deliver it to her only child, Eleanor.

  Elias kept his promise.

  **1939:** On Eleanor's fifteenth birthday, her adoptive mother gave her a small box. Inside were photographs of her birth mother, a letter addressed to Eleanor, written in meticulous handwriting, and a recipe for rose bread with a simple note: "From a friend of your mother's. She wanted you to have this. It was her favorite!"

  Eleanor would make the rose bread every day for the rest of her life.
