  most valuable assets in the bootlegging operation at the Harbor Import & Trading
  Co. He created and sold high-quality bootleg spirits disguised as medicinal tonics.
type: minor
content: '**The Black Sheep:** Sebastian Montgomery Crane was the black sheep of the
  Crane family. His brother Thaddeus was the golden child—the physician beloved by
  Long Beach society. Sebastian had spent his childhood setting small fires during
  chemistry experiments and mixing volatile compounds in his father''s shed. His parents
  had been equal parts proud and exasperated.


  By day: respectable pharmacist. Clean-cut, well-spoken, engaged to a Montrose.


  By night: "The Alchemist"—one of Frankie Romano''s most valuable assets in the bootlegging
  operation. A man who could transmute legality into fortune, who understood that
  the right chemistry could transform anything—prohibition into profit, powder into
  potion, law into opportunity.


  **His Genius:** Prohibition had been a gift to men like him. Through his connection
  with Frankie Romano at the port, Sebastian supplied half the speakeasies in Long
  Beach with grain alcohol—all perfectly legal, of course. Medical supplies. Medicinal
  tonics. The paperwork was impeccable. He created high-quality bootleg spirits disguised
  as pharmaceutical preparations. Legal cover, illegal profits.


  **His Operation:** Harbor Import & Trading Co. (Frankie''s smuggling front) supplied
  exotic ingredients—some legitimate, some not. Sebastian''s pharmaceutical expertise
  made him invaluable. He knew chemistry. He knew plants. He knew how to make things
  taste good and work better.


  **The Fortune:** The operation had been wildly successful. Sebastian had made a
  significant fortune and purchased a house on Ocean Boulevard. He no longer needed
  to get his hands dirty.


  **The Montrose Hypocrisy:** When Sebastian began courting Cordelia Montrose, her
  family was initially disapproving. "A pharmacist? Pursuing a Montrose?" But once
  they''d learned about his not insignificant fortune (of somewhat dubious origins,
  perhaps, but quite substantial nonetheless), they''d stopped asking questions.


  **The Dock Argument (February 1925):** When Sebastian got engaged to Cordelia, he
  wanted out of his criminal operation. He approached Frankie at the docks, certain
  the man would accept it eventually.


  But Frankie was furious. The argument was public. Loud. Dock workers turned to look.


  When Sebastian died shortly after, everyone assumed Frankie did it. But Frankie
  didn''t kill Sebastian. The real killer was much closer to home.
