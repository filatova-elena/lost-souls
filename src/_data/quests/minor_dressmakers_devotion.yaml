content: "Elias Monroe was a dressmaker with an artist's eye and a romantic's heart.\
  \ The day Cordelia Montrose walked into his shop, he fell in love.\n\nHe sent her\
  \ flowers, wrote her poems, made her dresses that would make other women weep with\
  \ envy. Each stitch was a declaration of devotion she never seemed to see. She smiled\
  \ at him kindly, but her eyes never lingered.\n\nThen she disappeared for months\
  \ in early 1925. When she returned, the lightness had gone out of her. She carried\
  \ something heavy, something unspeakable. \n\nThen came Sebastian Crane—dark-mysterious,\
  \ charming, yet stable, not like her first love Thomas Whitmore. Cordelia fell like\
  \ a moth to flame. Elias tried to tell her that Sebastian was not the man for her,\
  \ that he was too dangerous, but she dismissed him.\n\nSo he made her wedding dress\
  \ instead. White silk and lace, every stitch a prayer. He tucked a lock of her hair\
  \ into the hem—a secret goodbye.\n\nBy September, she looked pale, thin, trembling.\
  \ \n\nIn her final moments, Cordelia called for Elias. She gave him a handwritten\
  \ rose bread recipe and entrusted him to deliver it to her only child, Eleanor.\n\
  \nElias kept his promise.\n\n**1939:** On Eleanor's fifteenth birthday, her adoptive\
  \ mother gave her a small box. Inside were photographs of her birth mother, a letter\
  \ addressed to Eleanor, written in meticulous handwriting, and a recipe for rose\
  \ bread with a simple note: \"From a friend of your mother's. She wanted you to\
  \ have this. It was her favorite!\" \n\nEleanor would make the rose bread every\
  \ day for the rest of her life.\n"
