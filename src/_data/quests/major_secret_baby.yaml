  **Summer 1924:** Cordelia Montrose—romantic, dreamy, twenty-five years old—met Thomas Edward Whitmore at the Port of Long Beach. He was her best friend Alice's older brother. A merchant marine captain, about thirty, with stories of exotic ports and distant horizons.

  To Cordelia's sheltered life, Thomas was everything: adventurous, worldly, free. He promised to take her away, show her the world. It was a whirlwind romance. Passionate. All-consuming. The kind of love that burns bright and fast.

  Then Thomas sailed away. Did he mean to come back? Did he truly love her? We'll never know.

  He left without knowing Cordelia was pregnant.

  Soon after news arrived of Thomas's death at sea.

  **The Scandal (Early 1925):** The Montrose family was horrified. An unmarried daughter pregnant by a sailor? Unacceptable. They sent Cordelia away on "extended vacation." Her friend Alice complained she hadn't seen Cordelia in months, that Cordelia had become distant.

  In secret, Cordelia gave birth to a baby girl. The Montrose family arranged for the baby to be given to the Sullivan family—respectable bakers in Long Beach.

  In her final moments, Cordelia shared her secret with her friend and dressmaker, Elias Monroe. She gave him a rose bread recipe she loved and asked him to send it to her daughter, Eleanor.

  Cordelia died shortly after, her final thoughts were of her daughter, Eleanor.
