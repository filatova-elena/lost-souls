content: "**October 1925 - Cordelia's Final Gift:** In her final days, Cordelia Montrose\
  \ called for her friend Elias Monroe, the dressmaker. She was dying, pale and hollowed\
  \ out, but her mind was clear. She had one last request.\n\n\"I have a daughter,\"\
  \ she told him, tears spilling down her cheeks. \"Her name is Eleanor. I never got\
  \ to hold her. Never got to tell her I loved her. They took her away immediately—said\
  \ it was for the best.\"\n\nShe pressed a folded paper into his hand. It was a recipe,\
  \ written in her careful hand: **Rose Bread - My favorite.**\n\n\"I want Eleanor\
  \ to have this—to know she is connected to something beautiful, even if she doesn't\
  \ know all the reasons why.\"\n\nElias promised. He would find Eleanor. He would\
  \ make sure she knew.\n\n**1939 - Eleanor's Fifteenth Birthday:** On July 5, 1939,\
  \ Eleanor Sullivan's adoptive mother gave her a small box. Inside were photographs—a\
  \ woman with dark hair and sad eyes, beautiful in a way that made Eleanor's chest\
  \ ache.\n\n\"This is your birth mother,\" Mother explained. \"She loved you very\
  \ much. She wasn't able to raise you, but she wanted you to know what she looked\
  \ like. To know she hadn't forgotten.\"\n\nEleanor also found a letter addressed\
  \ to her, in handwriting she didn't recognize. Inside was a recipe.\n\n**Rose bread.**\n\
  \nThe note read: \"From a friend of your mother's. She wanted you to have this.\
  \ It was her favorite!\"\n\nEleanor would make this recipe every day for the rest\
  \ of her life. It was her only connection to the woman in the photograph.\n\n**1946\
  \ - The Connection:** Years later, standing in the bakery kneading dough, Eleanor's\
  \ mother complimented her technique. \"You have a gift for this,\" she said. \"\
  It's in your blood.\"\n\nEleanor thought: which blood? The Sullivan blood, from\
  \ the people who raised her? Or the blood of her birth mother?\n\nShe thought of\
  \ her every time her hands shaped the dough.\n\n**The Baker's Inheritance:** When\
  \ the Baker was left as an infant, an orphan, on the concrete steps of St. Mary\
  \ Medical Center, they had only one thing: a worn leather journal belonging to someone\
  \ named Eleanor. The journal contained a faded black-and-white photograph of a striking\
  \ young woman with large brown eyes and long dark hair, standing in a garden surrounded\
  \ by roses. And two recipes for rose bread: one old, fading, handwritten, and one\
  \ new, written in a neat, precise hand.\n\nNo note. No explanation. Just the journal,\
  \ the photograph, and the recipe.\n\nThat recipe was the Baker's only inheritance.\
  \ It was why they chose to be a baker—to feel closer to family even if they never\
  \ knew who they were.\n\n**The Discovery:** When the Baker came to the Montrose\
  \ mansion investigation, they brought rose bread—the same recipe from Eleanor's\
  \ journal. The Influencer recognized it: \"There's this whole crazy story about\
  \ a bakery that burned down in the 1990s? It was supposed to be famous for rose\
  \ bread.\"\n\nThe Baker learned: Eleanor Sullivan had founded Sullivan's Bakery\
  \ in 1940s. The bakery was famous for the family's rose bread recipe passed down\
  \ through generations. The Baker realized—it was Eleanor's diary they'd been carrying\
  \ their whole life. \n\n**The Secret:** In early 1925, Cordelia Montrose gave birth\
  \ to a daughter in secret. The baby was given to the Sullivan family—respectable\
  \ bakers in Long Beach. The arrangement was supposed to be an adoption.\n\nBut the\
  \ adoption was **never legally finalized.**\n\nOn paper, that baby—Eleanor Sullivan—remained\
  \ Cordelia Montrose's legitimate biological heir. And every descendant after her\
  \ inherited that legal status.\n\n**The Line of Inheritance:**\n\n- **Cordelia Rose\
  \ Montrose** (died 1925) → legal owner of estate\n- **Eleanor Sullivan** (born 1925)\
  \ → biological heir, adoption never finalized\n- **Eleanor's descendants** (Sullivan\
  \ family) → ran bakery for generations\n- **The Baker** (present day) → direct descendant,\
  \ true heir\n\n**The Whitmore Bloodline:** Eleanor's father was Thomas Edward Whitmore—the\
  \ merchant marine captain who loved Cordelia, and Alice Whitmore's older brother.\
  \ Alice was truly psychic, gifted with visions and premonitions that others dismissed\
  \ as hysteria. The Baker's spiritual sensitivity, their ability to sense things\
  \ others miss, comes from the Whitmore bloodline—from Alice's gift, passed down\
  \ through her brother's descendants.\n\n**The Revelation:** The Baker is standing\
  \ in their own family's mansion. The rose bread recipe—Cordelia's favorite—was the\
  \ legacy she left for her only child. A memory of warmth and roses woven through\
  \ generations, passed from Cordelia to Eleanor to the Baker.\n"
