objective: Uncover who paid Silas Blackwell to bury the truth in 1925. What was he
  paid to hide?
answer: Dr. Thaddeus Crane paid Silas Blackwell $500 in cash to falsify the death
  certificates and keep quiet about the discrepancies between his autopsy findings
  and the official causes of death. Silas discovered that Alice was murdered (not
  an accidental fall), Sebastian was poisoned (not accidental), and Cordelia died
  from chronic poisoning (not natural heart failure). He took the money but kept private
  notes documenting what he really found.

  **October 1925 - Three Bodies, Eleven Days:** Silas Blackwell had been a mortician for fifteen years, since returning from the War with hands too steady and a mind too comfortable with death to do anything else. He ran Blackwell & Sons Mortuary in Long Beach, handling the bodies of everyone who died in the town during the 1920s.

  But October 1925 was different. Three bodies arrived at his mortuary within eleven days. All young. All from the same estate. All suspicious.

  **October 11, 1925 - Alice Whitmore:** When Silas unwrapped the pristine white sheet covering Alice Whitmore, something in his chest tightened. She was twenty-four years old, beautiful, peaceful in death—except for the crushed wound at the back of her skull.

  He took meticulous notes. Blunt force trauma, no signs of struggle. Injury pattern inconsistent with accidental fall. Trauma angle suggests horizontal strike from behind.

  **October 11, 1925 - Sebastian Crane:** Acute poisoning. The damage extensive and unmistakable.

  **October 17, 1925 - Cordelia Montrose:** Signs of systemic poisoning. Hepatic damage present.

  **The Bribe:** Silas's thoughts were interrupted by a messenger appearing in the doorway—well-dressed, unfamiliar. "Letter for Mr. Blackwell."

  "From?"

  "No return address, sir." The man set the envelope on the desk and left quickly, his footsteps echoing down the stairs.

  Silas stared at the envelope. Expensive cream-colored paper. Heavy stock. The kind wealthy families used.

  He opened it slowly. Inside was a single card with a brief note in elegant script: **For your discretion.**

  Beneath it, folded carefully, was a five-hundred-dollar bill.

  Five hundred dollars. A fortune at the time—more than most morticians made in three months. He thought it must be the Montroses. People whispered about that family—how they protected their reputation at any cost.

  **The Compromise:** Silas looked from the money to his detailed notes. To the three death certificates already signed by Dr. Thaddeus Crane, each with causes of death that didn't match what the bodies revealed.

  **Alice Whitmore**—Cause of Death: Accidental fall. But his notes showed blunt force trauma from a heavy object.

  **Sebastian Crane**—Cause of Death: Suspected accidental poisoning. But his notes showed systematic organ damage from concentrated toxin.

  **Cordelia Montrose**—Cause of Death: Heart failure. But his notes showed chronic poisoning over weeks.

  Silas could report the discrepancies. He could go to the authorities. But five hundred dollars was a fortune. And who would believe a mortician over a respected physician?

  He put the money in his safe. He kept his private notes hidden. The dead were already dead after all and he had a family to feed.

  **The Truth:** The payment wasn't from the Montrose family. It was from Dr. Thaddeus Crane—the physician who had signed all three death certificates, the man who had everything to lose if the truth came out. Thaddeus had murdered Alice to silence her. He had poisoned his own brother Sebastian. He had been slowly poisoning Cordelia for weeks.

  And he paid Silas Blackwell $500 to make sure the official record would never reflect what the bodies revealed.
