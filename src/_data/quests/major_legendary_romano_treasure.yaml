content: '**The Glory Days:** In the shadows of Prohibition, Frankie "the Coast" Romano
  built an empire from the Port of Long Beach. Rum running from Mexico. Bootleg alcohol
  disguised as medicine. Exotic goods smuggled through Harbor Import & Trading Co.
  He was connected, ruthless, respected—a man who understood that power came from
  controlling what others couldn''t have.


  He supplied Sebastian Crane—"The Alchemist"—with bootleg spirits and rare botanical
  specimens, forging a partnership that would end in betrayal. When Sebastian tried
  to leave the operation after getting engaged, Frankie confronted him at the docks.
  A public argument. Dock workers watching. Frankie''s voice echoing across the harbor:
  "You don''t just WALK AWAY from Frankie Romano!"


  When Sebastian died days later, everyone assumed Frankie did it.


  **The Golden Years:** The Romano family went "legitimate"—nightclubs, gambling,
  early film industry connections. Flashy parties with starlets and producers. New
  money at its trashiest and most visible. Tabloids loved them. They were untouchable.


  Until they weren''t.


  **The Fall:** The IRS investigations began in the 1960s and dragged on through the
  1980s. The government seized everything—the nightclubs, the properties, the legitimate
  businesses Frankie had used to launder his empire. Bank accounts frozen. Assets
  auctioned. The Romano name became synonymous with scandal and downfall.


  But there were rumors. Whispers passed down through the family like heirlooms. Hidden
  wealth that had escaped the IRS. Gold, cash, jewelry—secreted away before the feds
  came knocking. The legendary "Romano treasure."


  **The Perfect Hiding Place:** When the investigations began, someone in the family
  made a desperate decision. The Montrose mansion had been abandoned since the deaths
  in 1925, sitting in legal limbo—a forgotten property, a perfect hiding place. No
  one would think to look there. No one would connect the Romano family to a Montrose
  estate.


  So they moved the most valuable pieces there. Art. Jewelry. Cash. Gold. And they
  left behind a map—a cryptic guide for left for future generations to find.


  **The Map:** The map is hidden in a purple and gold vase inside the Montrose Mansion.
  It points to the garden, to a spot where the treasure sleeps beneath the earth,
  protected by decades of silence and neglect.


  **Present Day:** The Art Collector, whose family name carries the weight of the
  Romano family, grew up on whispers of past glory and faded photographs. Learned
  art dealing through necessity, discovered genuine talent. Now runs a legitimate
  business—but still dabbles in questionable provenance and shady deals. One foot
  in legitimacy, one in the shadows. The Romano way.


  Whispers of the treasure have spread through the shadows—tempting treasure hunters,
  drawing the curious, haunting those who know the family name. The Art Collector
  carries the bloodline, the family secrets, the knowledge that might unlock what
  others cannot find. But in a house of secrets, nothing stays hidden forever. Someone
  will find it. The question is: who will reach it first?
