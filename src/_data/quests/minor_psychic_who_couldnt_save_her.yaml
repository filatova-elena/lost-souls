subtitle: Célestine Laveau & Alice Whitmore (1925)
type: minor
content: 'Célestine Laveau was world-famous long before she arrived in California.
  The French psychic medium had dazzled European aristocracy with her abilities—reading
  minds, communing with spirits, predicting futures with unsettling accuracy. When
  the spiritualism boom swept America in the 1920s, she came west, and Long Beach
  society clamored for her attention.


  Most of her clients were wealthy dilettantes playing at the occult. Parlor tricks
  for bored housewives. Theatrical séances for thrill-seekers.


  Then Alice Whitmore walked into her salon.


  Célestine knew immediately—this girl was different. Alice wasn''t performing. She
  wasn''t pretending. She had the genuine gift, raw and untrained, manifesting in
  dreams and visions she couldn''t control. The spirits spoke to Alice whether she
  wanted them to or not.


  "You have a rare ability, ma chérie," Célestine told her. "But it is dangerous without
  training. Let me teach you."


  Alice was eager to learn, desperate to understand the visions that haunted her.
  Célestine began mentoring her—teaching her to focus, to protect herself, to distinguish
  between true spiritual communication and her own fears.


  But Alice was also reckless. Impulsive. She fell into an affair with Dr. Thaddeus,
  ignored warnings, pushed boundaries. Célestine sensed darkness gathering around
  the girl but couldn''t make her listen.


  Then in October 1925, Alice was murdered.


  **The Haunting:** Célestine felt it immediately—Alice''s spirit, trapped, confused,
  unable to move on. The violence of her death, the secrets she carried, the unfinished
  business—it all anchored her to the mortal world.


  Célestine tried everything. Séances, rituals, prayers. But Alice''s spirit was bound
  by something stronger than death—by truth that needed telling, by justice that needed
  finding, by a story that refused to stay buried.


  Célestine Laveau, the famous psychic who had helped countless spirits find peace,
  could not save the one that mattered most. She died in 1947, her greatest failure
  haunting her legacy.


  Nearly a century later, her great-granddaughter Margo arrived in Long Beach, carrying
  the family name and the weight of unfinished business. Alice Whitmore was still
  calling. Still waiting.


  Some debts echo through generations.
