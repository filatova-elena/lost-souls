  **She was his patient.** That alone made it unforgivable.

  Alice Whitmore came to Dr. Thaddeus Crane in 1924 because other doctors wanted to institutionalize her. They called her "unstable," "hysterical," said her visions were delusions. Her family was concerned—she'd been having episodes since her brother Thomas died at sea. Nightmares. Fits of distress. Visions that terrified her.

  But Dr. Thaddeus believed her. He recognized Alice was truly psychic—not insane, just sensitive to truths others couldn't perceive. He listened to her describe her visions with remarkable clarity. He took detailed notes. He saw her intelligence shining through her distress, analyzing her own psychic experiences with precision.

  **The First Meeting:** In his office on Ocean Avenue, Alice sat in the leather chair across from his desk, her posture impeccable—back straight, ankles crossed, chin level. Only the slight tremor in her fingers betrayed her. She described her visions: Cordelia standing at a cliff's edge, a baby crying, blood everywhere. When she asked, "Dr. Crane? Do you think I'm mad?" he said softly: "I think that what you're experiencing is extraordinary. You are certainly not mad, Alice."

  Something shifted in his chest at that moment—professional detachment giving way to something more dangerous. Her eyes shone with an intelligence that recognized intelligence in himself. She breathed a sigh of relief and smiled, and he felt something he shouldn't have felt.

  **The Forbidden Affair:** Doctor-patient relationships were absolutely forbidden. But Alice was extraordinary—brilliant, gifted, and she saw him truly. They conducted their affair in secret. Hidden meetings in her garden, walking arm in arm among the hedges, his head bent close to hers as if sharing secrets.

  **The Discovery (June 1925):** Cordelia Montrose saw them together in the Whitmore garden. Walking arm in arm, very close. She was horrified. A doctor and his patient—it was completely, utterly inappropriate. She saw something in the way he looked at Alice—something proprietary, as if she belonged to him.

  Cordelia confronted Alice, warning her that Thaddeus's intentions might not be honorable. But Alice was defensive, hurt.

  **The Threat (September 1925):** Cordelia couldn't stay silent. She went to Thaddeus's office and confronted him. Thaddeus just smiled at her—that cold, calculating smile. "How very protective of you, Cordelia. How very noble."

  But the threat was real. Everything he'd built—his reputation, his practice, his social standing—could be destroyed by one scandal.
