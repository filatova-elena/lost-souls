  ## Prologue: The Inheritance

  The letter arrived on a Tuesday morning, embossed with the seal of a generational wealth management firm.

  **Miss Montrose,**

  "We are writing to inform you that you are the heir to the Montrose family estate located at Montrose Mansion, Long Beach, California. The property has been held in trust for several decades, and our records indicate you are the closest living relative with a legal claim..."

  The Heiress—tired of her overbearing family, hungry for independence—saw opportunity. A mansion of her own? In Long Beach? How glamorous. How perfect.

  The Fiduciary who tracked her down was thorough, pedantic, obsessed with proper documentation. They'd been managing the Montrose, Crane, and Whitmore estates for years. The mansion had been an eyesore, a wasted asset, abandoned for decades.

  So the Heiress moved in, expecting elegance and independence.

  She discovered, instead, that she was not alone.

  ## The Murder: What Really Happened

  ### The Secret Affair (1924-1925)

  Dr. Thaddeus Crane, the respected town physician, was conducting an illicit affair with his patient: **Alice Whitmore**. It violated every ethical boundary, but Alice was extraordinary—psychic, brilliant, and she saw him truly.

  They kept their relationship hidden. Secret meetings. Coded correspondence. The thrill of something forbidden.

  Then Cordelia Montrose discovered their affair.

  ### The Threat (Late Summer 1925)

  Cordelia confronted Dr. Thaddeus with an ultimatum:

  "End the affair with Alice immediately, or I will expose you to the medical board and to all of Long Beach society. Your career will be destroyed."

  Dr. Thaddeus realized he had only one way out: **eliminate Cordelia.**

  ### The Murder Weapon: A Poisoned Elixir

  Dr. Thaddeus knew his younger brother Sebastian was working on an "Elixir of Eternal Love." He examined Sebastian's formula—it was harmless. Foolish and romantic, but not dangerous.

  Thaddeus saw an opportunity. He secretly added concentrated foxglove extract to Sebastian's prepared elixir, making it deadly.

  ### September 4, 1925 - The Jupiter-Venus Conjunction

  **6:14 AM** - Sebastian administers the first dose of what he believes is his perfected elixir to Cordelia during the rare Jupiter-Venus conjunction. He has no idea his brother corrupted the formula with poison.

  ### September 4 - October 6, 1925 - The Slow Death

  Every morning, Sebastian adds the poisoned elixir to Cordelia's tea. She begins showing symptoms: weakness, nausea, confusion, cardiac irregularities. The poison accumulates slowly.

  No one suspects poisoning. Alice senses something is terribly wrong but doesn't understand what yet.

  ### October 7, 1925 - Sebastian's Discovery

  After a month of doses, Sebastian grows concerned. Cordelia isn't developing "unwavering devotion"—she's getting sicker. Confused and worried, Sebastian does what any arrogant alchemist would do: **he tests it on himself.**

  He drinks a concentrated dose directly from the bottle. The foxglove-laced elixir hits him immediately. Within hours, he's violently ill.

  ### October 7-11, 1925 - The Desperate Antidote Search

  Sebastian is dying. Dr. Thaddeus realizes with horror: **He's murdered his own brother.** Sebastian was never supposed to taste the elixir!

  Thaddeus frantically searches for an antidote—consulting experts, researching treatments, purchasing chemicals. This research leaves a trail of evidence. But foxglove is unforgiving. He can't save Sebastian.

  ### October 11, 1925 - The Confession & Murder

  Sebastian is dying. Thaddeus is wracked with guilt. He goes to the one person he trusts: **Alice Whitmore**, his secret lover.

  He tells her everything: how Cordelia threatened to expose their affair, how he poisoned the elixir to kill her, how Sebastian unknowingly administered it, how Sebastian accidentally poisoned himself.

  Thaddeus is desperate for absolution. But Alice is horrified. She urges Thaddeus to confess. Maybe it's not too late. Maybe they can still save Cordelia. But Thaddeus realizes Alice won't back down.

  Desperate and cornered, Dr. Thaddeus murders Alice Whitmore to silence her.

  **Location:** The mansion stairs
  **Weapon:** A heavy silver candle holder
  **Method:** Blunt force trauma to the head

  He stages it to look like an accidental fall. People will believe it—Alice was "unstable," she had "episodes." A tragic accident.

  ### October 11, 1925 - Sebastian Dies

  Sebastian Crane succumbs to foxglove poisoning. He dies thinking his own formula failed, that his "Great Work" was flawed.

  He never knows the truth: his brother corrupted his harmless elixir. He was innocent all along.

  Official cause: Suspected accidental poisoning. Everyone believes the mob (Frankie Romano) or his criminal dealings caught up with him.

  ### October 17, 1925 - Cordelia's Death

  Six weeks after the first poisoned dose, Cordelia Montrose dies. Her body, weakened by 43 days of accumulated foxglove, gives out. Cardiac arrest. Multiple organ failure.

  Official cause: Heart failure, natural causes. Rumors spread that she died of a broken heart, devastated by Sebastian's death.

  ### The Cover-Up

  Dr. Thaddeus Crane signed all three death certificates as the attending physician. He sends $500 anonymously to Silas Blackwell, the mortician, to keep quiet about discrepancies.

  On October 25, 1925, he seals Sebastian's laboratory and hides all evidence—notebooks, formulas, botanical specimens—in the abandoned garage.

  In his diary, he writes:

  "I could not destroy it all. Perhaps someday someone should know. But not now. Not while I live."

  He died in 1952, taking his terrible secret to the grave.

  ## The Three Ghosts

  ### The Lonely Ghost - Alice Catherine Whitmore

  **Age at death:** 28 years old
  **Date of death:** October 11, 1925
  **Official cause:** Accidental fall down the stairs
  **Actual cause:** Murdered by blunt force trauma

  Alice appears in a blue dress, pacing the stairs, searching for her best friend Cordelia. She was psychic—truly gifted with visions and premonitions. What others dismissed as hysteria was real sensitivity to hidden truths.

  She was in love with Dr. Thaddeus Crane, a forbidden affair that had to be kept secret. When he confessed his crimes to her, she threatened to expose him. He killed her to silence her.

  Her spirit is lonely because she lost her best friend, lost her secret lover, lost her own life, and spent 100 years unable to tell anyone what she knew.

  **What she knows:** She knows that Thaddeus Crane poisoned Sebastian's elixir with foxglove and that it killed Cordelia and Sebastian. But she will not give away that secret easily. She knows that someone murdered her - she felt a shadowy figure approaching, then something hit her head and she was dead.

  **What she doesn't know:** She doesn't know that Thaddeus Crane was the one who murdered her.

  ### The Cursed Alchemist - Sebastian Montgomery Crane

  **Age at death:** 30 years old
  **Date of death:** October 11, 1925
  **Official cause:** Suspected accidental poisoning
  **Actual cause:** Accidentally poisoned by his own formula (which his brother had sabotaged)

  Sebastian was a talented apothecary and bootlegger known as "The Alchemist" in Frankie Romano's organization. He created an "Elixir of Eternal Love"—a harmless romantic potion designed to strengthen his bond with his fiancée Cordelia.

  Unknown to him, his brother Dr. Thaddeus secretly corrupted the formula with deadly foxglove. When Sebastian tested his own creation, he died within days.

  He died never knowing he was innocent—never knowing his brother had sabotaged his work. His spirit is cursed because he believes his own incompetence destroyed everything he loved.

  **What he knows:** He knows that his elixir was making Cordelia sick, but ingredients were harmless or so he thought. He knows that the same elixir killed him as well.

  **What he doesn't know:** It was his own brother who corrupted the elixir with foxglove and killed him and his fiancée.

  ### The Heartbroken Spirit - Cordelia Rose Montrose

  **Age at death:** 26 years old
  **Date of death:** October 18, 1925
  **Official cause:** Heart failure, natural causes
  **Actual cause:** Slow poisoning with foxglove over 43 days

  Cordelia appears by the piano, playing a haunting melody, crying for her lost daughter and lost loves. She was once a romantic dreamer who believed in destiny.

  Her first love, Thomas Whitmore (Alice's brother), was a sailor who left her pregnant. The Montrose family forced her to give the baby away in secret. When Sebastian offered devotion and stability, she chose him.

  She discovered Dr. Thaddeus's affair with Alice and threatened to expose him. In response, he poisoned Sebastian's harmless elixir. Sebastian unknowingly administered the poison to Cordelia daily for six weeks.

  In her final days, sick and confused, she learned that both her best friend and fiancé were dead. All she could think of was finding her daughter, Eleanor.

  She died never knowing the truth.

  **What she knows:** She knows Thaddeus Crane was having and affair with Alice Whitmore and that she threatened him. She was getting sicker for the past month. News of Sebastian's and Alice's deaths recently arrived.

  **What she doesn't know:** She doesn't know that Thaddeus Crane was the one who murdered her, Sebastian and Alice. She doesn't even know anything about the poison or the elixir.

  ## The Competing Narratives: Lies & Truth

  ### SEBASTIAN'S DEATH

  #### ❌ LIE #1: Frankie Romano Killed Sebastian

  **The Story:** Sebastian tried to leave Frankie's criminal operation. Everyone heard their violent dock argument. Frankie murdered Sebastian as a warning—you don't walk away from the Romano family.

  #### ❌ LIE #3: Elias Monroe (The Dressmaker) Killed Sebastian

  **The Story:** The rival dressmaker, obsessed with Cordelia and jealous of Sebastian, poisoned him to eliminate competition.

  **Evidence:** Elias's desperate love letters, constant warnings against marriage, documented obsession, access to mansion.

  #### ✅ TRUTH: Dr. Thaddeus Accidentally Poisoned Sebastian

  **Reality:** Sebastian died from testing his own Elixir of Eternal Love—which his brother Dr. Thaddeus secretly sabotaged with foxglove. Sebastian was innocent, making a harmless romantic potion. He died never knowing his brother corrupted his work.

  **Evidence:** Sebastian's notebooks showing HARMLESS formula, Dr. Thaddeus's diary confession, antidote research trail (Oct 7-11), Professor Hartley's notes showing non-lethal botanicals, medical analysis showing concentrated foxglove, timeline of Sebastian's death after testing, poison residue in bottle.

  **The Story:** Alice discovered Sebastian was poisoning Cordelia. She confronted him, he killed her, then died from guilt or mob retaliation.

  #### ✅ TRUTH: Dr. Thaddeus Murdered Alice

  **Reality:** After confessing his crimes, Alice threatened to expose him. Dr. Thaddeus killed her with a silver candle holder and staged an accidental fall.

  ### CORDELIA'S DEATH

  #### ✅ TRUTH: Dr. Thaddeus Poisoned Cordelia
