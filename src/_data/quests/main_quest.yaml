content: "## Prologue: The Inheritance\n\nThe letter arrived on a Tuesday morning,\
  \ embossed with the seal of a generational wealth management firm.\n\n**Miss Montrose,**\n\
  \n\"We are writing to inform you that you are the heir to the Montrose family estate\
  \ located at Montrose Mansion, Long Beach, California. The property has been held\
  \ in trust for several decades, and our records indicate you are the closest living\
  \ relative with a legal claim...\"\n\nThe Heiress—tired of her overbearing family,\
  \ hungry for independence—saw opportunity. A mansion of her own? In Long Beach?\
  \ How glamorous. How perfect.\n\nThe Fiduciary who tracked her down was thorough,\
  \ pedantic, obsessed with proper documentation. They'd been managing the Montrose,\
  \ Crane, and Whitmore estates for years. The mansion had been an eyesore, a wasted\
  \ asset, abandoned for decades.\n\nSo the Heiress moved in, expecting elegance and\
  \ independence.\n\nShe discovered, instead, that she was not alone.\n\n## The Murder:\
  \ What Really Happened\n\n### The Secret Affair (1924-1925)\n\nDr. Thaddeus Crane,\
  \ the respected town physician, was conducting an illicit affair with his patient:\
  \ **Alice Whitmore**. It violated every ethical boundary, but Alice was extraordinary—psychic,\
  \ brilliant, and she saw him truly.\n\nThey kept their relationship hidden. Secret\
  \ meetings. Coded correspondence. The thrill of something forbidden.\n\nThen Cordelia\
  \ Montrose discovered their affair.\n\n### The Threat (Late Summer 1925)\n\nCordelia\
  \ confronted Dr. Thaddeus with an ultimatum:\n\n\"End the affair with Alice immediately,\
  \ or I will expose you to the medical board and to all of Long Beach society. Your\
  \ career will be destroyed.\"\n\nDr. Thaddeus realized he had only one way out:\
  \ **eliminate Cordelia.**\n\n### The Murder Weapon: A Poisoned Elixir\n\nDr. Thaddeus\
  \ knew his younger brother Sebastian was working on an \"Elixir of Eternal Love.\"\
  \ He examined Sebastian's formula—it was harmless. Foolish and romantic, but not\
  \ dangerous.\n\nThaddeus saw an opportunity. He secretly added concentrated foxglove\
  \ extract to Sebastian's prepared elixir, making it deadly.\n\n### September 4,\
  \ 1925 - The Jupiter-Venus Conjunction\n\n**6:14 AM** - Sebastian administers the\
  \ first dose of what he believes is his perfected elixir to Cordelia during the\
  \ rare Jupiter-Venus conjunction. He has no idea his brother corrupted the formula\
  \ with poison.\n\n### September 4 - October 6, 1925 - The Slow Death\n\nEvery morning,\
  \ Sebastian adds the poisoned elixir to Cordelia's tea. She begins showing symptoms:\
  \ weakness, nausea, confusion, cardiac irregularities. The poison accumulates slowly.\n\
  \nNo one suspects poisoning. Alice senses something is terribly wrong but doesn't\
  \ understand what yet.\n\n### October 7, 1925 - Sebastian's Discovery\n\nAfter a\
  \ month of doses, Sebastian grows concerned. Cordelia isn't developing \"unwavering\
  \ devotion\"—she's getting sicker. Confused and worried, Sebastian does what any\
  \ arrogant alchemist would do: **he tests it on himself.**\n\nHe drinks a concentrated\
  \ dose directly from the bottle. The foxglove-laced elixir hits him immediately.\
  \ Within hours, he's violently ill.\n\n### October 7-11, 1925 - The Desperate Antidote\
  \ Search\n\nSebastian is dying. Dr. Thaddeus realizes with horror: **He's murdered\
  \ his own brother.** Sebastian was never supposed to taste the elixir!\n\nThaddeus\
  \ frantically searches for an antidote—consulting experts, researching treatments,\
  \ purchasing chemicals. This research leaves a trail of evidence. But foxglove is\
  \ unforgiving. He can't save Sebastian.\n\n### October 10, 1925 (Evening) - The\
  \ Confession\n\nSebastian is dying. Thaddeus is wracked with guilt. He goes to the\
  \ one person he trusts: **Alice Whitmore**, his secret lover.\n\nHe tells her everything:\
  \ how Cordelia threatened to expose their affair, how he poisoned the elixir to\
  \ kill her, how Sebastian unknowingly administered it, how Sebastian accidentally\
  \ poisoned himself.\n\nThaddeus is desperate for absolution. But Alice is horrified.\n\
  \n### October 11, 1925 - Alice's Ultimatum & Murder\n\nAlice urges Thaddeus to confess.\
  \ Maybe it's not too late. Maybe they can still save Cordelia. But Thaddeus realizes\
  \ Alice won't back down.\n\nDesperate and cornered, Dr. Thaddeus murders Alice Whitmore\
  \ to silence her.\n\n**Location:** The mansion stairs  \n**Weapon:** A heavy silver\
  \ candle holder  \n**Method:** Blunt force trauma to the head\n\nHe stages it to\
  \ look like an accidental fall. People will believe it—Alice was \"unstable,\" she\
  \ had \"episodes.\" A tragic accident.\n\n### October 11, 1925 - Sebastian Dies\n\
  \nSebastian Crane succumbs to foxglove poisoning. He dies thinking his own formula\
  \ failed, that his \"Great Work\" was flawed.\n\nHe never knows the truth: his brother\
  \ corrupted his harmless elixir. He was innocent all along.\n\nOfficial cause: Suspected\
  \ accidental poisoning. Everyone believes the mob (Frankie Romano) or his criminal\
  \ dealings caught up with him.\n\n### October 17, 1925 - Cordelia's Death\n\nSix\
  \ weeks after the first poisoned dose, Cordelia Montrose dies. Her body, weakened\
  \ by 43 days of accumulated foxglove, gives out. Cardiac arrest. Multiple organ\
  \ failure.\n\nOfficial cause: Heart failure, natural causes. Rumors spread that\
  \ she died of a broken heart, devastated by Sebastian's death.\n\n### The Cover-Up\n\
  \nDr. Thaddeus Crane signed all three death certificates as the attending physician.\
  \ He sends $500 anonymously to Silas Blackwell, the mortician, to keep quiet about\
  \ discrepancies.\n\nOn October 25, 1925, he seals Sebastian's laboratory and hides\
  \ all evidence—notebooks, formulas, botanical specimens—in the abandoned garage.\n\
  \nIn his diary, he writes:\n\n\"I could not destroy it all. Perhaps someday someone\
  \ should know. But not now. Not while I live.\"\n\nHe died in 1952, taking his terrible\
  \ secret to the grave.\n\n## The Three Ghosts\n\n### The Lonely Ghost - Alice Catherine\
  \ Whitmore\n\n**Age at death:** 28 years old  \n**Date of death:** October 11, 1925\
  \  \n**Official cause:** Accidental fall down the stairs  \n**Actual cause:** Murdered\
  \ by blunt force trauma\n\nAlice appears in a blue dress, pacing the stairs, searching\
  \ for her best friend Cordelia. She was psychic—truly gifted with visions and premonitions.\
  \ What others dismissed as hysteria was real sensitivity to hidden truths.\n\nShe\
  \ was in love with Dr. Thaddeus Crane, a forbidden affair that had to be kept secret.\
  \ When he confessed his crimes to her, she threatened to expose him. He killed her\
  \ to silence her.\n\nHer spirit is lonely because she lost her best friend, lost\
  \ her secret lover, lost her own life, and spent 100 years unable to tell anyone\
  \ what she knew.\n\n**What she knows:** She knows that Thaddeus Crane poisoned Sebastian's\
  \ elixir with foxglove and that it killed Cordelia and Sebastian. But she will not\
  \ give away that secret easily. She knows that someone murdered her - she felt a\
  \ shadowy figure approaching, then something hit her head and she was dead.\n\n\
  **What she doesn't know:** She doesn't know that Thaddeus Crane was the one who\
  \ murdered her.\n\n### The Cursed Alchemist - Sebastian Montgomery Crane\n\n**Age\
  \ at death:** 30 years old  \n**Date of death:** October 11, 1925  \n**Official\
  \ cause:** Suspected accidental poisoning  \n**Actual cause:** Accidentally poisoned\
  \ by his own formula (which his brother had sabotaged)\n\nSebastian was a talented\
  \ apothecary and bootlegger known as \"The Alchemist\" in Frankie Romano's organization.\
  \ He created an \"Elixir of Eternal Love\"—a harmless romantic potion designed to\
  \ strengthen his bond with his fiancée Cordelia.\n\nUnknown to him, his brother\
  \ Dr. Thaddeus secretly corrupted the formula with deadly foxglove. When Sebastian\
  \ tested his own creation, he died within days.\n\nHe died never knowing he was\
  \ innocent—never knowing his brother had sabotaged his work. His spirit is cursed\
  \ because he believes his own incompetence destroyed everything he loved.\n\n**What\
  \ he knows:** He knows that his elixir was making Cordelia sick, but ingredients\
  \ were harmless or so he thought. He knows that the same elixir killed him as well.\n\
  \n**What he doesn't know:** It was his own brother who corrupted the elixir with\
  \ foxglove and killed him and his fiancée.\n\n### The Heartbroken Spirit - Cordelia\
  \ Rose Montrose\n\n**Age at death:** 26 years old  \n**Date of death:** October\
  \ 18, 1925  \n**Official cause:** Heart failure, natural causes  \n**Actual cause:**\
  \ Slow poisoning with foxglove over 43 days\n\nCordelia appears by the piano, playing\
  \ a haunting melody, crying for her lost daughter and lost loves. She was once a\
  \ romantic dreamer who believed in destiny.\n\nHer first love, Thomas Whitmore (Alice's\
  \ brother), was a sailor who left her pregnant. The Montrose family forced her to\
  \ give the baby away in secret. When Sebastian offered devotion and stability, she\
  \ chose him.\n\nShe discovered Dr. Thaddeus's affair with Alice and threatened to\
  \ expose him. In response, he poisoned Sebastian's harmless elixir. Sebastian unknowingly\
  \ administered the poison to Cordelia daily for six weeks.\n\nIn her final days,\
  \ sick and confused, she learned that both her best friend and fiancé were dead.\
  \ All she could think of was finding her daughter, Eleanor.\n\nShe died never knowing\
  \ the truth.\n\n**What she knows:** She knows Thaddeus Crane was having and affair\
  \ with Alice Whitmore and that she threatened him. She was getting sicker for the\
  \ past month. News of Sebastian's and Alice's deaths recently arrived.\n\n**What\
  \ she doesn't know:** She doesn't know that Thaddeus Crane was the one who murdered\
  \ her, Sebastian and Alice. She doesn't even know anything about the poison or the\
  \ elixir.\n\n## The Competing Narratives: Lies & Truth\n\n### SEBASTIAN'S DEATH\n\
  \n#### ❌ LIE #1: Frankie Romano Killed Sebastian\n\n**The Story:** Sebastian tried\
  \ to leave Frankie's criminal operation. Everyone heard their violent dock argument.\
  \ Frankie murdered Sebastian as a warning—you don't walk away from the Romano family.\n\
  \n**Evidence:** Public dock argument, dock workers' testimony, Sebastian's diary\
  \ (\"Frankie won't let me leave\"), Romano violence history, poison method is mob\
  \ signature.\n\n#### ❌ LIE #2: Montrose Family Killed Sebastian\n\n**The Story:**\
  \ The powerful Montrose family had Sebastian eliminated. A pharmacist with criminal\
  \ connections would destroy their reputation.\n\n**Evidence:** Montrose ruthlessness\
  \ (see: Baker's family arson), private investigator reports, large expenditures\
  \ in October 1925.\n\n#### ❌ LIE #3: Elias Monroe (The Dressmaker) Killed Sebastian\n\
  \n**The Story:** The rival dressmaker, obsessed with Cordelia and jealous of Sebastian,\
  \ poisoned him to eliminate competition.\n\n**Evidence:** Elias's desperate love\
  \ letters, constant warnings against marriage, documented obsession, access to mansion.\n\
  \n#### ✅ TRUTH: Dr. Thaddeus Accidentally Poisoned Sebastian\n\n**Reality:** Sebastian\
  \ died from testing his own Elixir of Eternal Love—which his brother Dr. Thaddeus\
  \ secretly sabotaged with foxglove. Sebastian was innocent, making a harmless romantic\
  \ potion. He died never knowing his brother corrupted his work.\n\n**Evidence:**\
  \ Sebastian's notebooks showing HARMLESS formula, Dr. Thaddeus's diary confession,\
  \ antidote research trail (Oct 7-11), Professor Hartley's notes showing non-lethal\
  \ botanicals, medical analysis showing concentrated foxglove, timeline of Sebastian's\
  \ death after testing, poison residue in bottle.\n\n### ALICE'S DEATH\n\n#### ❌\
  \ LIE #1: Alice Fell Down the Stairs\n\n**The Story:** Tragic accident. Alice was\
  \ \"unstable,\" possibly drunk or delirious. She fell or took her own life.\n\n\
  #### ❌ LIE #2: Sebastian Killed Alice\n\n**The Story:** Alice discovered Sebastian\
  \ was poisoning Cordelia. She confronted him, he killed her, then died from guilt\
  \ or mob retaliation.\n\n#### ✅ TRUTH: Dr. Thaddeus Murdered Alice\n\n**Reality:**\
  \ After confessing his crimes, Alice threatened to expose him. Dr. Thaddeus killed\
  \ her with a silver candle holder and staged an accidental fall.\n\n**Evidence:**\
  \ Injury pattern inconsistent with fall, medical records ruling out suicide, silver\
  \ candle holder (murder weapon), Dr. Thaddeus's diary confession, timeline (Alice\
  \ died same night she threatened exposure), Alice's psychic notes about dangerous\
  \ secrets, mortician's private notes documenting discrepancies.\n\n### CORDELIA'S\
  \ DEATH\n\n#### ❌ LIE #1: Cordelia Died of a Broken Heart\n\n**The Story:** When\
  \ Sebastian died, Cordelia couldn't bear it. Already fragile from her pregnancy\
  \ scandal, she wasted away from grief. Natural causes.\n\n#### ❌ LIE #2: Sebastian\
  \ Poisoned Cordelia\n\n**The Story:** Sebastian deliberately poisoned his fiancée\
  \ with his \"Elixir of Eternal Love\" because he was jealous and obsessive.\n\n\
  #### ✅ TRUTH: Dr. Thaddeus Poisoned Cordelia\n\n**Reality:** Dr. Thaddeus sabotaged\
  \ Sebastian's harmless elixir by adding concentrated foxglove, intending to kill\
  \ Cordelia to prevent her from exposing his affair. Sebastian unknowingly administered\
  \ the poison daily from September 4 to October 6. Cordelia died October 17 from\
  \ accumulated toxin damage.\n\n**Evidence:** Dr. Thaddeus's confession, medical\
  \ analysis showing cumulative foxglove poisoning over 6 weeks, Sebastian's original\
  \ harmless formula vs. corrupted version, Cordelia's diary showing she threatened\
  \ Thaddeus, timeline (first dose Sept 4, death Oct 17 = 43 days).\n"
