objective: Discover the truth behind Sebastian's elixir. What were the exact ingredients
  and what was its purpose?
answer: Sebastian's "Elixir of Eternal Love" was a harmless romantic potion designed
  to strengthen the bond between lovers. The formula contained botanical ingredients
  (damiana, valerian root, rose otto, ginseng), pharmaceutical compounds (potassium
  bromide, calcium lactate, iron citrate), grain alcohol base, and flavorings (vanilla,
  cherry syrup, honey). Thaddeus Crane corrupted the formula with foxglove.

  **Five Years of Research:** Sebastian Crane began working on his "Elixir of Eternal Love" in 1920, driven by a romantic belief: "What is love but chemistry?" He believed in the marriage of science and mysticism—that the right formula could transform attraction into devotion, desire into permanence.

  For years, he refined the formula. Consulted botanical experts. Adjusted ratios. Crossed out failed attempts. The final formula was precise:

  **Botanical Ingredients:** Damiana (3 parts) for desire and awakening, sourced from Harbor Import & Trading Co. Valerian root (2 parts) for calm and trust. Rose otto (1 drop only)—the pure essential oil from Milano, representing Venus and transcendence. Ginseng root (smallest pinch)—the precious Korean variety, the binding agent for eternal love.

  **Pharmaceutical Compounds:** Potassium bromide (10 grains) as a mild sedative. Calcium lactate (5 grains) for fortification. Iron citrate (3 grains) as a blood tonic. All standard, all safe.

  **Base & Flavorings:** Grain alcohol (8 oz at 95% proof) as the carrier and preservative. Vanilla extract, cherry syrup, and honey to mask the bitter botanicals and create something palatable. Even pleasant.

  Every ingredient was harmless. Every component was safe.

  **The Missing Piece:** In January 1925, Sebastian found it—the ginseng root. He consulted Professor Edmund Hartley, the botany expert at the university, who explained its three-thousand-year history in Chinese medicine, how it represented permanence, endurance, and the binding of souls. "Just a small amount," Sebastian wrote. "Enough to whisper 'forever' into the formula."

  **Professor Hartley's Verification:** Throughout August 1925, Sebastian made three visits to Professor Hartley's botanical consultation service to refine his formula. He presented each ingredient—damiana, valerian, rose otto, ginseng, and the pharmaceutical compounds. Hartley verified each ingredient and concentration, checking ratios and interactions. His final assessment: "Completely sound, all ratios appropriate, no toxic components, no harmful interactions." He warned about storage conditions, but the formula itself was harmless. Hartley's documentation would later prove crucial—the original formula was safe. Someone had to have corrupted it.

  **The Celestial Timing:** Sebastian timed the elixir for September 4, 1925—the rare Jupiter-Venus conjunction, a celestial alignment that occurs only once in a generation. At 6:14 AM, he administered the first dose to Cordelia.

  **The Daily Ritual:** Every morning, Sebastian added the elixir to Cordelia's tea. After weeks of daily doses, Cordelia wasn't developing "unwavering devotion"—she was getting sick. Weakness. Nausea. Confusion. Cardiac irregularities.

  **The Self-Test:** On October 7, 1925, Sebastian grew concerned. Confused and worried, he did what any arrogant alchemist would do: he tested it on himself. He drank a concentrated dose directly from the bottle. Within hours, he was violently ill.

  **The Foxglove:** The poison was **Digitalis purpurea**—foxglove. A beautiful flowering plant with bell-shaped purple blooms, commonly used in 1920s medicine for cardiac conditions. But in concentrated doses, foxglove is deadly. It contains cardiac glycosides that cause severe heart irregularities, organ failure, and death. The symptoms match exactly: cardiac distress, nausea, confusion, weakness, and ultimately organ failure.

  Sebastian's original formula contained no foxglove. Professor Hartley had verified this. But Thaddeus Crane had added concentrated foxglove extract to the elixir. When Thaddeus visited Hartley on October 15, asking detailed questions about the formula's safety, Hartley confirmed everything had been appropriate. But Hartley sensed something was wrong. In his private notes, he questioned his own assessment: "The formula was safe. I verified this. Didn't I?"

  The bitter taste of the foxglove was masked by the honey, vanilla, and cherry syrup Sebastian had included. The daily doses accumulated in Cordelia's system over weeks, slowly poisoning her. When Sebastian tested a concentrated dose on himself on October 7, the acute poisoning killed him within days.

  **The Tragic Truth:** Sebastian died believing he had killed the woman he loved. He wrote in his final notebook entry: "I gave her poison thinking it was poetry." He died thinking his Great Work had failed.
