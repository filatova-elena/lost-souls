subtitle: A Modern Crime (November 1990)
objective: Discover the truth behind the Sullivan bakery fire. Who was responsible?

  ran the bakery. The Sullivans were the true heirs to the Montrose fortune through

  came in the darkness, murdered David and Catherine Sullivan, set the fire, and fled.
  But he couldn't kill the baby.

content: "**November 5, 1990:** Sullivan's Bakery, a Long Beach institution for over\
  \ sixty years, burned to the ground in the dead of night. The fire spread with unusual\
  \ rapidity, consuming the building before firefighters could respond.\n\n**The Victims:**\
  \ David Sullivan, 38, owner of the bakery. Catherine Sullivan, 36, his wife. Both\
  \ found dead in the ruins. Reports stated the Sullivans had an infant child, though\
  \ no body was recovered despite extensive searches of the charred remains.\n\n**The\
  \ Official Story:** Fire Marshal David Chen stated: \"The fire spread with unusual\
  \ rapidity. The preliminary finding is electrical wiring failure.\" Case closed.\
  \ Tragic accident.\n\n**The Evidence:** But responding firefighters noted accelerant\
  \ patterns. The blaze had spread too fast, too hot, too completely. One neighbor\
  \ reported seeing an unidentified figure fleeing the building in the darkness, just\
  \ before the flames erupted.\n\n**The Timing:** The fire occurred just as new interest\
  \ in the 1925 Montrose mystery had surfaced. Investigations were being reopened.\
  \ Old documents were being examined. The Sullivan family had operated the bakery\
  \ continuously since 1927, founded by Eleanor Sullivan—a name that appeared in those\
  \ historical records.\n\n**The Truth:** This was no accident. The Montrose family,\
  \ known to be ruthless and powerful, hired an arsonist to eliminate the Sullivan\
  \ family. The reason was money: the Sullivans were the true heirs to the Montrose\
  \ fortune.\n\n**The Night of the Fire:** Thomas Reed, 69, arrived at the bakery\
  \ after closing, in the dead of night. Catherine Sullivan, the Baker's mother, realized\
  \ what was happening. She was holding her baby, and in that moment of terror, she\
  \ made a desperate plea: \"Please, not my baby!\"\n\nWhile pleading, while distracting\
  \ the arsonist, she did something else—something that would matter more than her\
  \ own life. She secretly tucked an old diary under the baby's blankets. Her last\
  \ act. Her final gift.\n\nThomas Reed set the fire, but he couldn't kill the baby.\
  \ \n\nHe grabbed the infant carrier, oblivious to the diary wedged deep between\
  \ the quilted padding and the plastic shell. He left the bundle on the concrete\
  \ steps of St. Mary Medical Center, disappearing into the salt-thick Long Beach\
  \ night. Unknowingly he left behind the diary—Catherine’s final gift to her child,\
  \ a voice from the past that would one day tell them exactly who they were.\n\n\
  **The Aftermath:** In March 1991, Thomas Reed was arrested on multiple charges including\
  \ property destruction. He was living under an assumed name, refused to cooperate\
  \ with questioning, and his associates remained unknown—protecting those who hired\
  \ him. The investigation never fully officially connected him to the Sullivan fire.\n\
  \nThe baby was the sole surviving member of the Sullivan family. The fire had consumed\
  \ everything else—the bakery, the family, the documents. All that endured was a\
  \ small, cloth-bound diary, its cover bearing no name, its pages holding nothing\
  \ but a handful of mysterious photographs of a beautiful woman in a rose garden,\
  \ her dress and bobbed hair unmistakably of the 1920s, and a single handwritten\
  \ recipe for rose bread. With no title on the binding and no signature within, the\
  \ book offered no clues to the child's identity, leaving the Sullivan legacy to\
  \ be swallowed by the ash, —and but for a single recipe, which holds the key to\
  \ the past.\n"
