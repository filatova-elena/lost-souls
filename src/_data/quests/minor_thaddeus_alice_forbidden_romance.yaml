content: "**She was his patient.** That alone made it unforgivable.\n\nAlice Whitmore\
  \ came to Dr. Thaddeus Crane in 1924 because other doctors wanted to institutionalize\
  \ her. They called her \"unstable,\" \"hysterical,\" said her visions were delusions.\
  \ Her family was concerned—she'd been having episodes since her brother Thomas died\
  \ at sea. Nightmares. Fits of distress. Visions that terrified her.\n\nBut Dr. Thaddeus\
  \ believed her. He recognized Alice was truly psychic—not insane, just sensitive\
  \ to truths others couldn't perceive. He listened to her describe her visions with\
  \ remarkable clarity. He took detailed notes. He saw her intelligence shining through\
  \ her distress, analyzing her own psychic experiences with precision.\n\n**The First\
  \ Meeting:** In his office on Ocean Avenue, Alice sat in the leather chair across\
  \ from his desk, her posture impeccable—back straight, ankles crossed, chin level.\
  \ Only the slight tremor in her fingers betrayed her. She described her visions:\
  \ Cordelia standing at a cliff's edge, a baby crying, blood everywhere. When she\
  \ asked, \"Dr. Crane? Do you think I'm mad?\" he said softly: \"I think that what\
  \ you're experiencing is extraordinary. You are certainly not mad, Alice.\"\n\n\
  Something shifted in his chest at that moment—professional detachment giving way\
  \ to something more dangerous. Her eyes shone with an intelligence that recognized\
  \ intelligence in himself. She breathed a sigh of relief and smiled, and he felt\
  \ something he shouldn't have felt.\n\n**The Forbidden Affair:** Doctor-patient\
  \ relationships were absolutely forbidden. But Alice was extraordinary—brilliant,\
  \ gifted, and she saw him truly. They conducted their affair in secret. Hidden meetings\
  \ in her garden, walking arm in arm among the hedges, his head bent close to hers\
  \ as if sharing secrets.\n\n**The Discovery (June 1925):** Cordelia Montrose saw\
  \ them together in the Whitmore garden. Walking arm in arm, very close. She was\
  \ horrified. A doctor and his patient—it was completely, utterly inappropriate.\
  \ She saw something in the way he looked at Alice—something proprietary, as if she\
  \ belonged to him.\n\nCordelia confronted Alice, warning her that Thaddeus's intentions\
  \ might not be honorable. But Alice was defensive, hurt. \n\n**The Threat (September\
  \ 1925):** Cordelia couldn't stay silent. She went to Thaddeus's office and confronted\
  \ him. Thaddeus just smiled at her—that cold, calculating smile. \"How very protective\
  \ of you, Cordelia. How very noble.\"\n\nBut the threat was real. Everything he'd\
  \ built—his reputation, his practice, his social standing—could be destroyed by\
  \ one scandal.\n"
