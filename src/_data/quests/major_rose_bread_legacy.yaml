  **October 1925 - Cordelia's Final Gift:** In her final days, Cordelia Montrose called for her friend Elias Monroe, the dressmaker. She was dying, pale and hollowed out, but her mind was clear. She had one last request.

  "I have a daughter," she told him, tears spilling down her cheeks. "Her name is Eleanor. I never got to hold her. Never got to tell her I loved her. They took her away immediately—said it was for the best."

  She pressed a folded paper into his hand. It was a recipe, written in her careful hand: **Rose Bread - My favorite.**

  "I want Eleanor to have this—to know she is connected to something beautiful, even if she doesn't know all the reasons why."

  Elias promised. He would find Eleanor. He would make sure she knew.

  **1939 - Eleanor's Fifteenth Birthday:** On July 1, 1939, Eleanor Sullivan's adoptive mother gave her a small box. Inside were photographs—a woman with dark hair and sad eyes, beautiful in a way that made Eleanor's chest ache.

  "This is your birth mother," Mother explained. "She loved you very much. She wasn't able to raise you, but she wanted you to know what she looked like. To know she hadn't forgotten."

  Eleanor also found a letter addressed to her, in handwriting she didn't recognize. Inside was a recipe.

  **Rose bread.**

  The note read: "From a friend of your mother's. She wanted you to have this. It was her favorite!"

  Eleanor would make this recipe every day for the rest of her life. It was her only connection to the woman in the photograph.

  **1946 - The Connection:** Years later, standing in the bakery kneading dough, Eleanor's mother complimented her technique. "You have a gift for this," she said. "It's in your blood."

  Eleanor thought: which blood? The Sullivan blood, from the people who raised her? Or the blood of her birth mother?

  She thought of her every time her hands shaped the dough.

  **The Baker's Inheritance:** When the Baker was left as an infant, an orphan, on the concrete steps of St. Mary Medical Center, they had only one thing: a worn leather journal belonging to someone named Eleanor. The journal contained a faded black-and-white photograph of a striking young woman with large brown eyes and long dark hair, standing in a garden surrounded by roses. And two recipes for rose bread: one old, fading, handwritten, and one new, written in a neat, precise hand.

  No note. No explanation. Just the journal, the photograph, and the recipe.

  That recipe was the Baker's only inheritance. It was why they chose to be a baker—to feel closer to family even if they never knew who they were.

  **The Discovery:** When the Baker came to the Montrose mansion investigation, they brought rose bread—the same recipe from Eleanor's journal. The Influencer recognized it: "There's this whole crazy story about a bakery that burned down in the 1990s? It was supposed to be famous for rose bread."

  The Baker learned: Eleanor Sullivan had founded Sullivan's Bakery in 1942. The bakery was famous for the family's rose bread recipe passed down through generations. The Baker realized—it was Eleanor's diary they'd been carrying their whole life.

  **The Secret:** In July 1924, Cordelia Montrose gave birth to a daughter in secret. The baby was given to the Sullivan family—respectable bakers in Long Beach. The arrangement was supposed to be an adoption.

  But the adoption was **never legally finalized.**

  On paper, that baby—Eleanor Sullivan—remained Cordelia Montrose's legitimate biological heir. And every descendant after her inherited that legal status.

  **The Line of Inheritance:**

  - **Cordelia Rose Montrose** (died 1925) → legal owner of estate
  - **Eleanor Sullivan** (born 1924) → biological heir, adoption never finalized
  - **Eleanor's descendants** (Sullivan family) → ran bakery for generations
  - **The Baker** (present day) → direct descendant, true heir

  **The Whitmore Bloodline:** Eleanor's father was Thomas Edward Whitmore—the merchant marine captain who loved Cordelia, and Alice Whitmore's older brother. Alice was truly psychic, gifted with visions and premonitions that others dismissed as hysteria. The Baker's spiritual sensitivity, their ability to sense things others miss, comes from the Whitmore bloodline—from Alice's gift, passed down through her brother's descendants.

  **The Revelation:** The Baker is standing in their own family's mansion. The rose bread recipe—Cordelia's favorite—was the legacy she left for her only child. A memory of warmth and roses woven through generations, passed from Cordelia to Eleanor to the Baker.
