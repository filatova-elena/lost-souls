## Summary

**Total unassigned clues: 1**

## Unassigned Clues

### Documents (1 unassigned)

1. **File:** `src/_data/clues/documents/legal_birth_cert_sebastian.yaml`
   - **ID:** `NO_ID` (missing `id` field)
   - **Type:** Document (Legal)
   - **Title:** Birth Certificate - Sebastian Montgomery Crane
   - **Issue:** This file does not have an `id:` field, so it cannot be automatically assigned to an act.
   - **Action needed:** 
     - Add an `id:` field to this file, OR
     - Add this clue to `clue_organization.yaml` if it should be included, OR
     - Remove this file if it's a duplicate (there was also a `sebastian_birth_certificate.yaml` file that appears to have been removed)

## Previously Fixed

- ✅ `crystal_ball` - Fixed: Added `act: act_iv_revelation` (was missing act field despite having ID in organization file)

## Notes

- All other clue files (174) have been successfully assigned to acts
- The assignment script requires clue files to have an `id:` field to match against the organization file
- Files without IDs cannot be automatically assigned and must be handled manually
